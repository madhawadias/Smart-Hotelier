"Clare","Fabulous!","This is a lovely hotel, very well priced for excellent service (Particularity Sajid in the Ocean restaurant), old school style luxe. Location is a little noisy currently due to construction works nearby, not the hotels fault but something to bear in mind if you wish to spend significant time by the pool.","Date of stay: March 2020"

"Derek","3 Nights at the Kingsbury","The bed was the hugest that I have ever slept in! I enjoyed the breakfasts; the dining area was vast and offered a great variety of food. The staff was very helpful and friendly. One morning a waiter named Joseph made a couple of pots of coffee just for us. Another morning a waitress called Nipuni went and brought egg hoppers to my table for me. I loved the location, and I recommend a walk along the beach day or night, when it is bustling with activity.","Date of stay: February 2020"

"roshneil","Identity crisis","Nalitha was great at check in. Hotel is quite nice, Hotel is having a bit of an identity crisis, it is a cross between a 5 star hotel and a after 6pm sort of turns into a rave type party with the horrendous loud doof doof  music being played until 11pm, it’s  what I would expect from a back packers hostel. For this reason I would not stay here again","Date of stay: March 2020"

"Junhi","my stay was comfortable, staff friendly, but apart from managers, they need to train more their staff in English","The hotel is one of the oldest one which has been renovated with a fine taste, quite elegant and it has a heritage flair, which I liked very much. The room is small but well organized, the only thing I did not like was the low ceiling, probably they squeezed the building to have more storeys when they renovated.  And many of staff needed to improve their English, otherwise, my stay was comfortable and food in cafeteria is quite good.","Date of stay: February 2020"

Cons:1. booked a superior OCEAN view room, was particularl on this and paid extra online. At reception, checked in at around 4pm, and front desk Mr. Ishaack gave us another non sea facing room, saying it is better category. But when we book and pay for ocean view, we expect that or they should not advertise the same. As many other hotels can offer same. 2.

Employee name - Ajith, and the Duty  Manager (Didn't get his name). I'm sure they hired these individuals right off the street to keep operating cost down. We usually visit the Honeybeach pub once a week to catch up. After a chilled out evening, my friend proceeded to collect his vehicle from their glorious carpark. Lol. We were confronted by a midget named ""Ajith"". He had very ""Suge Knight"" attitude. He requested a ""bill"" from the pub. Apparently, if you need to collect your vehicle from their carpark, you need show your expenditure at this establishment. So ""No bill, No Vehicle"". We took our concerns to the ""Duty Manager"".

Room service provided tasty food.","Our first night after a long and tedious flight from Canada 🇨🇦 was continually disturbed by some unruly guests of a “wedding party “ occupying the adjoining room.  We checked in around 11 am  and noticed a number of noisy men in the hallway. The noise factor continued but got uglier when the unruly highly intoxicated men took the liberty of sprawling in the hallway. One of them knocked at our door around 1:30 am and apologized. The hotel should exercise caution when assigning rooms to ‘one-night only’ patrons who obviously lacked decorum - guess they had they didn’t  care that other guests were trying to rest.

The hotel itself is good - lovely rooms and setup, nice touches, wonderful checkin etc. but the poolside in the evening has basically ruined everything. We’ve been sitting around waiting to get a menu and drinks. I asked for a menu from someone who did not return. I can see staff milling around not doing much. The music is far too loud for the evening and on the other side of the building is another wedding party, also loud. I can hear the booming noise from the 7th floor room. Why can’t the hotel appreciate that people want a quiet evening and sleep? Absolutely shoddy and it’s left a really sour taste. What a shame.

The disco beats from the pool bar echo to dangerous noise levels above the pool for those who wish to swim at sunset. Rooftop bar is unaccessible without ear protection, and its basses resonate over the below hotel floors. Smoking is permitted up to pool edge. The touchscreens of half the fitness equipment are broken, leaving the equipment in state of no use. Management should prioritise being either an entertainment palace for day visitors or offering a city oasis for staying residents.","Date of stay: January 2020"

"Annie Bucker","Annie Australia","We stayed at Kingsbury for 2 days in January 2020. Breakfast was good with variety of food. The room of the hotel need to be renovated as it looks a bit old. The swimming pool was good but for a 5 star hotel, it should be compulsory for everyone to have wash before entering the pool. There was a lot of indian people and no one had wash before entering the pool and my husband and I did not go in the pool after seeing that. The top room restaurant is very expensive and we don't recommend anyone to go their. We spent 100 Australian dollars and we were still hungry after that. The Galle face One shopping centre is just 10 minutes walk and there are lots of restaurants downstairs with cheaper food. Overall the service of the hotel was not bad.","Date of stay: January 2020"

"Paul Carr","Service Has Dropped","We are regular visitors here and as such that implies we must like the place, and we do. Since the bomb blast last April naturally a few alterations have been made as well as a few that were planned anyway.   Having booked directly with the hotel months back our intial observations were disappointing as I had booked 2 rooms, one for my wife and I and one for my brother and his wife, yet were charged two different rates by 2 different payment methods. I think when my brother paid they simply converted the $ rate to £ yet for mine for some reason they converted it to Sri Lankan Rupees and then to Pounds resulting in me paying £40 more for the same thing. This is just wrong and needs a consistent approach.  We also didn't get the Galle Face road view rooms we had booked instead","Date of stay: January 2020"

It is located within a 2 minute walk to famous Galle Face Green, Dutch Hospital Restaurant strip and a few minutes’ walk from the recently open Modern Shopping Complex “ No.1 Galle Face”.  This is our 4th visit to this hotel. We stayed this time for 7 nights from 9 December. Check-in process was ok. As we were repeat customers we were upgraded to a deluxe room. Our preference was for the Premier room which we were given before . However when the staff member referred to a manager he was not receptive to the idea. In our past visits we were given a warm welcome by the reception staff and went out of their way to look after us. We found the service level in this regards has dropped.

I had left my room pass by the pool by accident. He offered to get me a new one to save me from going back down. I thought he was only doing this for a tip (this was always the case in the other two mentioned hotels... in fact things were often wrong when I called to complain they would come up to fix things but stand there waiting for a tip eg my safe not working in Cinnamon Grand), however Priyal flat out refused to take the tip, it was like he genuinely took pride","Date of stay: December 2019"

Chef Jayasinghe and the breakfast staff carved out a sumptuous breakfast for us. The special attention they gave us will be remembered for a very long time. Hoppers (both egg hoppers and panni hoppers) are hard to replicate anywhere. The fruit platter (like mangoes) and the thambili was like the icing on the cake. Breakfast could not get any better. Thank you so much. Next is the room service. We stayed on level 8. Piyal, Isuru and the crew weaved magic in our room. The daily creations kept us spell bound.

The food was well prepared and delicious and with the attentive staff at both the restaurants and in-room dining, meal times were very enjoyable. The view of the ocean was breathtaking.

We had two interconnecting rooms on the 8th floor.  The Kingsbury has a desk at the airport and if you have booked transfers through them, it is a welcome respite from the hectic-ness of the airport to have them guide you through it to the transfer.

This hotel is in a great part of town, plenty of trending places in the lanes around the Dutch district to eat and drink pity we are only here for one night. The highlight though is the biggest buffet in the world, maybe the universe and at around $25AUD a head how can you resist. Highly recommend.   There is though a downside, expansion/reclamation of the foreshore in front of the hotel will mean in the next few years what was once beachfront, will eventually be back streets, pity really, so visit soon.","Date of stay: March 2019"

This hotel is right in the middle of where you want to be to see the sights in Colombo- The Presidential buildings are next door, markets, St Anthony's cathedral, temples, CCC (Shopping centre) and Galle face (park) are all within walking distance or 5-10 mins by tuk tuk. The area is SAFE.  THe actual hotel though, has the feel of an upper market hotel with piano room, pool (kids pool as well). The only drama is sometimes the lift wasn't working and service was hit and miss. If you are using this as a base camp to head out then you've chosen well. They are reclaiming land next door so this location will only intensify itself as the heart of the tourist region.","Date of stay: January 2019"

Check-in / reception were really friendly, as were the bell boys. It lacked a little polish to make it stand out amongst other 5 star hotels, but for the price, it's a really great hotel.

You can try different kind of dishes from its restaurants like Harbor court, Gourmot station,Honey beach club etc.","Date of stay: December 2018"

The hotel pool side becomes very lively at night time which makes it all more interesting and happening.  Food and customer service is worth the money spent. Some time you would feel the lobby is over crowded which doesn't gives a feel of 5star properly. Other then that all is good and worth it.","Date of stay: September 2018"

It didn’t start well and went downhill from there.  Check-in wasn’t easy although some of that may have been due to linguistic problems and the noise in the reception area.  The corridor to our rooms in a no smoking area smelt of cigarette smoke though the rooms didn’t.  A suitcase lock was damaged, the restaurant service in the buffet restaurant was at best poor.  The wine we ordered was out of stock, no problem, but when told this we weren’t given the wine list back to chose an alter but had to ask for it. Plates from the table weren’t cleared and we had to move them to","Date of stay: January 2019"

The rooms are great, the breakfast outstanding, and the pool is very good. Overall, a very good hotel.","Date of stay: January 2019"

The service was impeccable and I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat. The pool was huge and open late. The bar and dj played music till late at night which was nice for those on holiday. View of the port and a main road. The interior of the hotel was luxurious down to the bathroom supplies being from BLVGARI. The rooms were large and all level 2 rooms had a balcony which was stunning to relax in. The rooftop bar was beautiful but you need to be 18+ to enter which was difficult when my party had 8 adults and a 1 year old. There was a range of shops available onsite and the reception staff were fantastic.","Date of stay: January 2019"

Concierge service was great and the shops and the layout at the ground floor (reception area) was nothing you were in another hotel. The piano, the fish tank, the design gives you a great atmosphaire and then you walk to the room and you are questioning yourself.....?!

Both the reception area and the restaurant were superbly decorated for Christmas and the New Year. The room was nice but rather small.

In fact my husband got the Steak chopped into small pieces which he sent back to the kitchen. Hotel Room was a nice & cleaned. We enjoyed drinks in 2 bars which were also ok. Most of all we like the location since the hotel is located just in front of the Galle Face Green facing Indian Ocean. Sadly our day 1 was raining therefore we couldn’t enjoy a walk on the beautiful Galle Face Green. Breakfast was ok mixed with few cuisines but majority of the breakfast items were Indian & Sri Lankan, therefore for Westerners not that much good unless they like those food.","Date of stay: December 2018"

Having has such a nice experience we returned for dinner (in long pants!) And had amazing steaks in The Grill - better cooked than many I've had in London.

Like most SL hotels, peak period room rates are higher than comparable rates in other SE Asian destinations. Restaurant prices a bit on the high side. Minor comment - Noticed a few small cockroaches around the place, even in the spa room! Can be a common problem in tropical climates and not restricted to this hotel. Perhaps regular pest control will fix this before it gets out of hand. Will stay here again as it is a great property with excellent staff, facilities","Date of stay: January 2019"

On the promise of an early transfer during our seven day stay, we accepted the offered rooms on the opposite side.  Once in the rooms we thought we had made a terrible choice - could not believe the level of noise coming in from the poolside Honey Beach Club where a live band was playing - it was far from the 'five star' 'perfect' experience advertised on the website & we had to shout at each other to communicate.

The Kingsbury is hands down the worst experience around!  My wife and I were very much looking forward to spending NYE at The Kingsbury. We'd booked The Kingsbury Suite - their best room.  The Kingsbury has a severe identity crisis! It doesn't know whether it's a Bacardi sponsored, Bali-Esk, pool resort, a W style funky destination or a colonial era, heritage, hotel!?! It's lost!

From the time we stepped into the hotel the experience was not great. Our room configuration was incorrect for triple rooms which had to be made up as the rooms were made up with a queen bed only. It didn’t stop there the rooms did not have towels on both days we stayed. The hotel lacks controlling noise, I complained about our neighbors kids playing in the passage and making a racket which went unaddressed for hours. Breakfast layout with food choices was great but the overall service from the waiters were lacking.

Everything about this hotel is so welcoming, symbolising the best of Sri Lankan hospitality -- subtle and sure, but not overbearing. The hotel is quiet, and yet very convenient.

"sammywarna","Afternoon Tea at The Kingsbury","I was visiting Sri Lanka for my Mother’s 75th birthday and thought it would be nice to take her and five of her friends for afternoon tea.  The afternoon tea at at The Kingsbury was rated highly and so I chose this venue for my guests.  Much to my disappointment, despite there being a large quantity of food, I felt the quality was poor.  Despite there being a lot of staff milling around, the service was terrible - lack lustre and dismissive.  Finally, despite having seven guests, they tried to charge me for 9 and asked me to leave my debit card with them when I questioned the bill.  I rarely find myself so deeply disappointed in a so-called ‘top’ hotel, but I know for certain that I will never visit the Kingsbury again.","Date of stay: September 2018"

We had two rooms each time as we were a family of 5.  The breakfast buffet was truly amazing.  It had a mixture of a European breakfast, American breakfast, and of course the most delectable SriLankan foods.  The service was that of a private bungalow.  Many times we felt as if we had our own servers and bellman.  Feroz Ahamath was helpful in helping us with a reservation that was not easy to acquire.","Date of stay: June 2018"

We went for a low key informal steak sandwich at the pool restaurant which was great. The server also walked us through the happy hour offers, and even came to check just before it finished whether we needed any more drinks.

The hotel is well situated with a nice view all round. This time I was in room 807 facing Gaule Face and the reclamation under way. The bed is excellent and comfortable. The 5 restaurants offers unlimited choice of food that would surpass your expectation. I have never been in a hotel that offers such large variety of foods for breakfast. Prove me wrong!! I highly recommend this establishment to any way visiting Colombo.","Date of stay: August 2018"
"Vaish-Maranganty","Once glamorous, now on the edge of a land reclamation project","First the positives: got upgraded to a big room! The hotel is in the heart of the business district, great for an easy commute to meetings etc. It’s also a stone’s throw away from the Dutch Hospital complex, so easy walk to restaurants. The Breakfast buffet offers a wonderful spread including lots of Sri Lankan specialties.   On the downside, the land around the hotel is now part of a huge reclamation project. 24/7 you can see earth movers doing their thing. No view of the sea. The pool must have been on the edge of the sea at one time, but now just borders a small road with traffic. Very weird! The rooftop bar has the same fate. At some time it must have given a beautiful view over the sea, now it just overlooks unending sand!  Bottom line: stay if you’re a business traveler","Date of stay: February 2018"

So, I am totally in love with the food.  Cocktails – Very interesting list. And I tried 3, which I don’t remember the names now. But they can improve the quality of the cocktails. It’s clearly less alcohol.","Date of stay: July 2018"

But the restaurant was ridiculously crowded — hordes of people standing in line diminished the experience.  Perhaps they should have a separate dining setup for conference attendees.  The wait staff were not always around.  Went to the Hilton buffet the next day and that was a much more pleasant experience.  No sea view anymore — reclaimed beach view.","Date of stay: August 2018"

Looks to have once been a sea front hotel but land reclamation is moving the sea front further and further out in this location. Lots of choices for dining and a very good if not enormous buffet. In the seafood restaurant you choose your fish from a display and then choose how it will be cooked. Good rooftop bar with great views. My room overlooked the pool with the drawback of the music from the pool bar. This became a DJ in the evenings. The room was clean and comfortable and all the amenities you needed.

The only area that could be improved is the Sunday morning breakfast. Many hotels extend the breakfast time till 11.00 am on a Sunday morning because guests tend to stay up late on a Saturday night and like to sleep in for longer. However, at Kingsbury, guests have to wake up earlier because the breakfast ends at 10.00 am on a Sunday morning instead of the usual 10.30 am.","Date of stay: August 2018"

The food, although not the best I’ve had, was very good. Great value for money.  The waitstaff though, could’ve improved. Not sure whether it was because of the holidays, it was the day after avurudu ( maybe they were understaffed?). The table was not cleared after a course was done,while we went to grab the next one, resulting in quite a crowded table and I had to constantly ask the staff to fill my glass with water.  Hope they would have  straightened out those issues the next time around.","Date of stay: April 2018"

Once we got into the room, we got the wrong room instead of a superior twin beds room. After, complaining to the reception, they change our room without any apologies. Later in the day, we did get chocolate in our room but it was not for us but for two other people, which is pretty funny but I am not sure how to take this safety wise?!

We looked at the menu and there was no vegetarian option.  I could not order from The Grill ( fair enough) so my colleagues only option was the Room Service menu.

The afternoon was not looking like a fun one, but thankfully our hotel called The Kingsbury and a plan was made.  The Kingsbury served lunch to non-guests and made a reasonable charge for use of the pool. Suddenly, things were looking up.  The lunch was a buffet and by this time, I was a bit bored with this sort of thing, but the quality and variety of the food was excellent, far better than anything I'd had so far.

When I complained to management they did attempt to resolve the issues, but not to my satisfaction, and there should not have been so many failings in the first place.

Little did I knew one other guest pointed me to get away from that place and since there was a foul smell I did stepped away.  However my wife trampled that soon after and we got to know it was not curry but human poop YUCK!.   At that time the staff came and put tissues and tried mopping the foor.

They should not mislead the customer. Chef should have a better knowledge of what fish he is serving..","Date of stay: December 2017"

Half the waiters deliberately avoided me unless I was standing next to someone white. Finger food that was supposed to be hot was served cold.

They turned off the ac one hour before event was supposed to close. Extra small sushi rolls served with nothing to serve wasabi or the ginger slices, you had to stick your fingers in to get the slices. They stopped serving finger food half way and people thought the food was over so they had dessert.

I enjoyed the tasty crushed ice fruit drink and later a hot cup of tea. There was at least one other cold drink option on offer too.  We had a secluded table for two by the pool which was welcome, as this high tea is always well patronized and certain areas seem a little more crowded.  Money's worth.","Date of stay: November 2017"

The room was very nice with a good bathroom.  It had a nice big window but the “sea view” was a crock as it looked over the construction zone and port - this view will disappear altogether when the financial city is complete - and also looked over the pool with its noisy nightclub from 5:30pm to midnight.

He quoted us a certain price for a car and driver for the day, and then while we were on the journey, he called to ask us for more money for “extra costs” he claimed we had agreed to!

Watch out as there are people trying to send you places dressed smartly outside the hotel. Seasoned travelers will figure it out as soon as they try to suggest a 'good discount'.

"349richardsc","If you want authentic “High Tea” in Colombo, Sri Lanka, avoid the one at the Kingsbury Hotel.","There are several places one could opt to have “High Tea” in Colombo, Sri Lanka. If you are the type that enjoys a quiet afternoon authentic “High Tea” in Colombo, Sri Lanka,  the place to visit is certainly not Kingsbury Hotel.  This hotel has a lot of pluses such as its location but it has not learnt the art of presenting an authentic “High Tea”, even allowing for some variations to please the local palate. One would have to look for some other place in Colombo that does a better job or go to London to experience the mystique English afternoon High Tea at one of the famous departmental stores in Central London or better still wait for an invitation by Queen Elizabeth to have tea with her!  The tradition of afternoon High Tea originated in England during the early 19th century.","Date of stay: November 2017"

We ate breakfast in the hotel and there  was a good choice of cooked, Asian and continental, personally we thought the continental was a bit stale and not as fresh as it could be.

The Sky Lounge (see my separate review) is dreadful and the pool is spoiled by moronic music played at ridiculous volumes.  Over-loud music seems to be a theme at the hotel, because the band in the Kings Lounge is also too loud for conversation.

Given the amount of weddings and events happened during our stay, I guess this is the place to be in Colombo.  As a minus, I would have expected the room preparation for the night.","Date of stay: September 2017"
"David B","Regular guest","I have visited most of the larger hotel chains in colombo but was back for the 5th time at the kingsbury this month. Got a discount on the early check in and fair roomrate.

"Don P","Extremely Luxurious","Interior and exterior of the hotel is extremely luxurious. Clean, Comfortable beds and bathrooms can not be compared to any other. Has fantastic breakfast choices with live cooking. Only drawback is unfriendly staff. Lady who's at the front desk to welcome guests for the breakfast is so boring and wearing a dull face entire time. There was no proper greetings to welcome the guest. Poor performance of the staff in that manner. Apart from that any person could check this hotel for luxurious vacation in the colombo city center.","Date of stay: August 2017"
"Thilinee Siriwardane","Over working staff","I have always been amazed by the little gestures and the compliments that I receive as a guest at 5 star hotels. But being at Kingsbury made me realize that they have over working chefs and staffs.  I've seen the same chefs since my arrival in the morning till night working in the kitchen.   Speaking to one of the staff related to why the reason is even more shocking.  I am sad related to this matter. Being a five star hotel, they should be treating the staff with more respect about their personal life just as their work life.  I hope I receive a good solution from the management related to the matter.   Next time when I visit the hotel, I hope to receive genuinely happy staff than a bitter sad story from their faces.  My solution is to increase their packages if working more","Date of stay: September 2017"

Service was poor and the staff seemed tired and disengaged with the diners.

Have had better experiences at the same buffet.","Date of stay: September 2017"
"TheKidsMum2014","Nice place to recover after your flight","We checked into this hotel after our flight and enjoyed the clean and comfortable rooms. The food was ok - buffet style - although no 'wow' factor. We really liked the bar around the pool and ordered pizza there (which was delicious.) Sadly, the service at the bar was awful. We waited 35 minutes for our drinks and it was not busy! We ordered a second round (which was brave,) but they never arrived, so we left. This hotel used to have a beachfront but unfortunately it is now the victim of a government scheme to develop land into the sea and build. There are no real views bar cranes and views of the port.. This is a good place to stay for one night as you recover from a flight and embark on travels to other parts of Sri Lanka!","Date of stay: August 2017"

"Travellerfr0mH0lland","Mixed feelings ...","One of the biggest disadvantages of deciding in favour of  a big hotel is that often it's rather impersonal. The Kingsbury is no exception in this respect. Check in as well as check out process rather slow, as tons of other things are going on at the reception desk and no one seems to care you're waiting there forever. There's no way you can find yourself a seat, as hall always seems to be occupied by wedding guests (we saw at least 5 wedding parties during our one night stay!). Suggestion: make a separate entrance for wedding parties  Room was small, but clean and bed was comfortable. However, the music coming from the outdoor pool area was loud and we had to request for another room (which was no problem). Apparently the music is allowed from late in the afternoon till 10 pm.","Date of stay: August 2017"

At check in, we were told one of the two rooms had been upgraded to a suite and that we had to wait 20 minutes so they could finish up in the room. The rooms were very basic and pretty small and after an hour of being in the room we were on the phone to the front desk making a complaint. The India cricket team (the second team/extras) were occupying 80% of the 2nd floor and noise levels were high and doors were left wide open so everyone could see/smell the mess that was made in their rooms. The hotel had zero power in this and instead we were moved to the 9th floor so the people on the 2nd could continue making noise.  Swimming pool/outdoor area was good. Loud music, good vibes!","Date of stay: August 2017"

We stayed for four nights in total and were upgraded to a suite free of charge. Despite the cranes on the beach, which we knew would be the case beforehand, the view was great and the room felt really luxurious. Staff were friendly and polite.  The only downside was that some staff were either very slow to respond to requests or didn't respond at all. This is a shame for such a wonderful hotel.

The hotel is a ""wedding factory"" and not for tourists. Don't be fooled by the differing prices of the rooms. They are exactly the same but just on different floors. In the rooms the beds and pillows are supremely comfy and the shower is excellent but sadly there is a massive building site outside the hotel all along the beach which is full of diggers and cranes which looks set to be there for years and eventually the whole building complex will completely block the view of the sea.

Upon arrival and throughout our stay the Kingsbury exceeded all our expectations. Very smooth check in and great service from Shiran Fernando who was able to upgrade our room to the Executive level 8 facing the beach and city. beautiful room and facilities and a great view and the room was quiet.

Yes, we took a few second before deciding to accept the table shown by the manager and i apologised for that but i guess the manager was still upset. He just walk away after we were seated. There were only one other table occupied but it took a while before someone finally came to take our orders though there were at least 3 waiters on duty. Thereafter it was definitely unfriendly service thoughout the whole dinner. The foods and deco were excellent but it left an unpleasant experience.","Date of stay: July 2017"

The pool area has a great bar and restaurant attached to it..very beach cabana style..We didn't go the gym nor the Spa as after a day fighting Colombo traffic all we wanted was a cold beer on the roof top sky bar, which is one of the prime reasons why you should stay here.

The service did not live up to expectation of a top Chinese Restaurant at a 5 Star Hotel. It was service without a smile. We have to request 2 to 3 times to get something done. The Captain and the waiters were more busy talking among themselves. It was unlike any restaurants we visited in Colombo. Having said that, I must compliment the chef as it serves one of the best Chinese food around. If only the service could be the same.

Then after a good heated discussion he gave me two rooms at the same floor but diametrically apart. Nothing less than a nightmare dealing with the guy on the reception.

"Andrew P","Great hotel, let down by nearby development","I have stayed at the Kingsbury twice now for work. The hotel is excellent, service is great and the restaurants well worth it. The hotel used to be waterfront, but now that they are building the new waterfront it has lost some of its waterfront benefits. The hotel itself is reasonably central, but there are others that are better for that. Both my business trips were short stays which made this hotel a quality option, but I suspect I would stay elsewhere if I was looking at a longer stay.","Date of stay: March 2017"

Although there is some construction work going on nearby which you could hear early morning and at night, it didn’t affect our sleep at all, indeed we noticed that earplugs were provided in the bedside drawers...but not really needed.

I had stayed here before and the food is good, the rooms are clean and the location is good.  This time I arrived on Halloween.  Apparently the Kingsbury has a rave the night of Halloween down by the pool.  The music was throbbing the entire building until 5am - full blast volume.  If I was 22 and looking for a party this would have been awesome.  Being there on business and expecting quiet sleep while paying to stay in a luxurious hotel, I was not happy.

A big plus is the Executive Lounge and butler service. The lounge is open 24 hours, making it an ideal place to do work. The availability of drinks 24 hours was a big plus. Staff were very good, with Glen being a stand out member. Overall however, I think that the executive floor is best suited to business travellers.

We did not intend to spend so long there, but somehow, the high tea at the Gourmet station was just so good, we spent an hour and more!  The food was a delicious spread of salads, sandwiches, savouries and sweets! There was somrthing for everything, including ice cream, milkshakes, black tea, coffee, and even a local drink made of rose and vanilla ice cream! (Faluda, I believe).  What made it fantastic were the staff. Smiling, willing to chat, and ready to help, they really made it a great place to relax and unwind.  Highly recommend coming, even just once.

First, you have all the building work going on around the hotel, pretty much non stop. Then there's the pool area, and also the rooftop bar. Both places play music incredibly loud at night, even when there's no one actually sitting in these areas! It can be heard until late in the room - not ideal for a few good nights sleep after the long flight to Sri Lanka.

Sadly there is a considerable amount of building works taking place by a Chinese company at the shore, where land is being reclaimed from the sea, and this area when complete will be used as a financial district for Colombo, so part of the uninterrupted views of the Indian Ocean from The Kingsbury will sadly be lost.

This hotel was very European in design and culture but with a Sri Lankan twist which made it different.

"funtbw","6 Nights in Colombo","We spent 6 nights at this city centre hotel. We had a lovely suite on the corner with a sea view. Can't fault overall the quality of service, food etc. However one point to be aware off...The hotel is adjacent to a large sea reclamation project less than 30 metres from the hotel which often is a 24x7 activity! Sometimes the noise at the pool was unpleasant and even on the 8th floor where we stayed the noise kicked off from 6-7am. The hotel seems to deny any knowledge of its existence -""it's a government project / nothing to do with us "". If you stay, while this project is ongoing, I'd recommend you take a room away from the sea overlooking the city - it may be quieter.","Date of stay: February 2017"

Our room was a little oasis of comfort, though not large it was well fitted out with plenty of amenities like fluffy robes and slippers, Bulgari toiletries and a supremely comfortable bed. The location was great as we had a dinner reservation at Ministry of Crab across the road. Unfortunately did not experience the breakfast as we had to leave early for the airport but we were furnished with a more than adequate breakfast pack to take with us. Decor is glitzy and modern in the lobby and public areas but pure comfort in the guest room.Wish we'd had longer to enjoy it.","Date of stay: February 2017"

"ZachIO","A very relaxing and comfortable stay","The Kingsbury offers everything you expect from a 5-star hotel. It is a high-end hotel with excellent service. Slight drawbacks is that for some reason it took a bit longer than usual to check-in and that the free Wi-Fi in the room drops out every now and then. The location is very nice just a short walk from the Dutch Hospital and World Trade Center areas. Also, the current beach front construction kind of ruins the magic but that is of no major concern. A highly recommended hotel, would gladly stay there again!","Date of stay: February 2017"

"Rachel L","Very comfortable stay","We stayed in the Kingsbury on our last night of a week-long tour around Sri Lanka. In comparison with other hotels in Sri Lanka, the Kingsbury was excellent.  At times, the wifi was slightly slow but that was rare.  The airconditioning in the room was easily adjustable and was effective and efficient in cooling the room.  The bathroom feels spacious despite not actually being very big. There was more than enough space around the bathroom sink to place our toiletries. We also had no problems with the shower. The complimentary toiletries are also of excellent quality (carrying the Bvlgari label no less).  The buffet breakfast is excellent in variety. There are both local and international options available. Just the variety of sweet breads alone was overwhelming (in a good way).","Date of stay: January 2017"

The various restaurants are top end with excellent food. The buffet at breakfast is unreal and high tea in the afternoon is wonderful. Location is on the water and central to the old district of Imperial  Britain.  Just watch out for the ripoff tuk tuk drivers. Dont get in unless you have agreed to a fair price.

Nearly all of the TV channels were in English. I had the breakfast buffet which had a vast selection available, the king’s bar was good for an evening drink. One negative was the hotel car cost, usual cost to the airport is around 2,800 LKR including toll, however the hotel car is LKR 5,200. I would definitely use again when in Colombo.","Date of stay: January 2017"

After a long travel with a long transit all we wanted was to go rest in our room.  The room itself was lovely but I think the bathroom needs to be updated.  Unfortunately our views looked out on construction works being done on the beach and into the water.  This continued nearly 24hrs!  We had no views at all.  I spoke to our booking company who took up our complaint with the Hotel.  There response.......not their issue, they are not creating the works!  We were not even offered any credit, or written reply from their Hotel.

We arranged for a taxi from the airport through Airport Tourist Drivers Association as this was cheaper than using the hotel car (both hotel branded and normal car through hotel was more expensive than this).  The hotel itself looks stunning from outside when its all lighted up.  Check in was swift and pain free.    Room was a decent size and our view was to the front of the hotel and the roof.  There was quite a significant amount of building work going on along the seafront so the views werent that great.  Skybar have to say though was stunning and quite popular.  If you need to get around get a tuk tuk as the traffic is so busy.  Lovely hotel, breakfast was ok.  The only downside when we stayed was that there was only one lift","Date of stay: October 2016"

So, it is what it is and that is TERRIBLE! What makes it worse, is that I went down to their restaurant for breakfast and even though here were maybe only 8 guest seated, the host at the host stand chatted with staff and ignored me, so I seated myself. Then I had my entire meal without even being offered something to drink, although two servers were across the room and looked my way.

The hotel is very popular with locals for functions and wonderful weddings.  The Kingsbury is ideally located however major waterfront works have ruined the views but hopefully this is only a short term issue.  As the air-conditioning made the restaurants too cold to be in for any longer than a quick meal or drink we would highly recommend the Sky Lounge to while away a few hours at night. The pool area was pleasant but noisy with the construction works nearby.

And I'm not taking off a star for the loud music either (from floor 10, I could hear it on floor 4), as it's that time of year. Instead, it loses a star because it was just a bit grubby in places. This would not be a problem at all at a cheap or even normal-priced hotel, but this one charges a lot to stay so should be aiming higher. Some of the doors, walls and carpets need a proper clean, and the state of the two roofs on either side of the main tower is pretty shameful.

"piriot","Excellent hotel but the port is under construction, once finished this will be great!","We really enjoyed our stay in Kingsbury Hotel. As it was full moon, we saw a lot of weddings and took a lot of pictures in the entrance hall. We did not try the pool as we were busy going around in Colombo and elsewhere in Sri Lanka, but from the window it looked great. The only problem is the construction site just outside by the seaside. The Chinese are building a new port, for sure also beautiful sailing boats will be there, maybe a beach, but now it is just noisy. Unfortunately, The staff is friendly, and helpful, also the breakfast buffet is really good, worth the money as one can pick up fruits, Sri Lanka type of breakfasts that is different cooked vegetables in various ways, as well as eggs in any way you want and also sweet cakes and cheeses. All there. The service at","Date of stay: December 2016"
"Caitlin C","Lovely room, a bit noisy, food satisfactory, service good","Basically, the Kinsbury is a luxury place. The room lives up to standards and is very sweet, well decorated & idiosyncratic - feels like a small boutique hotel rather than a large business one.   However, we were on the side of the pool / Ocean Bar and it was quite noisy in the evening with karaoke / live bands. This wasn't a huge problem, but something to be aware of when booking.  We had breakfast included, and it was okay. It wasn't terrible by any means, but it definitely wasn't great quality. The food had been staying out for a while as things were drying out. It would be better if they had less, and really focused on quality, than tried to cater for everyone and everything for breakfast - it's not really necessary. The service was fine in terms of person-to-person","Date of stay: December 2016"
"chandrika b","A taste of luxury in Colombo","The hotel is located in town near very good restaurants i.e. Ministry of crabs. The restaurants in this hotel is quite good. The buffet breakfast and lunch has an immense selection with everything looking every bit delicious and inviting. The food was mostly exquisite.   One thing to note is that there are major constructions near this hotel- major reclaiming of land happening. This hotel is no longer overlooking the sea. It's pretty sandy out there as works are ongoing. The pool is pretty much deserted due to this.  Rooms and amenities were wonderful did comfortable. Hotel staff were accommodating. Toiletries were Bvlgari. Aim to come here to enjoy indoors.","Date of stay: November 2016"
"as392","Satisfactory hotel, centrally located","We spent two nights at the Kingsbury. The hotel itself has a unique colonial feel and charm to it.  The ocean views are a bit marred due to the ongoing large-scale port construction, so that was a little disappointing.  The wifi is spotty and the hotel is often hosting many events (weddings + conferences) so there are usually crowds in the lobby during the morning and evening hours.  The on-site restaurants are very good, and the breakfast buffet was very impressive with a large variety of Sri Lankan and English breakfast options.  I really enjoyed the ambience of the rooftop bar for an evening cocktail and snack as well.  I used the gym facilities which were modern and spacious, but because it was located on the street-level and has large windows, people walking by would stare","Date of stay: November 2016"
"timeg","Would not recommend","We stayed at this hotel for 3 days.  On check in, the hotel put a hold on our credit card to cover the booking, which is normal procedure and at that point was no problem (I will come back to this).    The good - The hotel is in a great location and close to the Dutch Hospital shopping/restaurants (practically across the road), and easy to get a tuk-tuk into the city and around.  It is not too far from the Pettah Markets but would suggest a tuk-tuk. Easy walk to Galle Face Green.  The not good - on two occasions (that we know of) our room door would not lock.  Something wrong with the electronic locking system and maintenance had to fix it.  The lifts don't have security access, so anyone off the street can access the hotel floors.  Rooms are OK but for the price, there are","Date of stay: October 2016"
"Adnan K","Nice Hotel with a great view","I stayed in Kingsbury for three week. The hotel will give you the feel of colonial Ceylon. I liked the enormous chairs ! Hotel room was nice and clean. Take Galle Face (Sea view room). From my 7th floor room view was amazing. Be aware of weddings which will happen almost everyday ! They have a GM who personally checks everything. Their Sunday Brunch is quite impressive. Don't forget to take a walk on the sea side road next to hotel before sunset. Hotel staff were very friendly. They have a amazing sea food restaurant called 'Ocean'.","Date of stay: August 2016"
"Prachi Joshi","Centrally located","Located on the seafront, The Kingsbury is also a short walk from the quirky Old Dutch Hospital precinct. The rooms are a bit small and the ones on a lower floor have no view. I was given a room on the 2nd floor overlooking the ugly roof, so I asked for a change. I was switched to the 7th floor, which smelt of stale cigarette smoke. Well, at least I had a bit of a sea view. The view is soon going to be lost, though, as there is a major reclamation work ongoing that will push the coastline further away. The hotel will soon be looking at a business district, which is a shame.   The breakfast buffet is plentiful and varied. I didn't try any other meals in the hotel, but it's supposedly known for its elaborate afternoon tea. Wi-Fi is free but very erratic","Date of stay: November 2016"
"LarsoLongo","High tea was great fun","We had heard about high tea in Sri Lanka from friends and saw that Kingsbury have one. We brought our 2 kids (4 and 8) to it and had fun. There was a fashion show that added to the sparkle. The food was good and there was  heaps of variety, my kids loved the ice cream cones. Excellent value too. Thanks for a great time. Would love to do it again.","Date of stay: December 2016"

The rooms are a bit small but they are very comfortable.  The breakfast has a huge spread offering options to all sorts of customers.  The sky bar is a must visit.   However, there is a construction site right across the road, which disrupts the view from your room and even the swimming pool.

"Jake c","Grand rooms and amazing bar","Stayed here for our first night in Sri Lanka before heading to Kandy. The rooms were amazing, very nice bed and excellent added services like choosing the type of pillow you want! The building is amazing and has lovely, attentive staff too. Breakfast was a buffet. Was nice enough but the pancake chef offered my girlfriend cold pancakes. When asked for fresh, he again just pointed to the cold ones. Also, I cut my foot at the pool on a tile. The staff were very quick to help patch me up though. Only downside is the Chinese funded port being constructed right outside the hotel, so the infinity pool looks over a building side at the moment. The beers too were overpriced considering they were cans. Would be acceptable in a bottle but not a can. The views from the bar were amazing.","Date of stay: November 2016"

The large, airy lobby was beautiful and the check-in a breeze.  The rooms are well more than adequate, you really feel as if the people there take pride in their work.  Very clean and comfortable and a delightful night of sleep.  Easy access to a seaside stroll along Galle Face drive with small vendors, kite flying, and wonderfully cool breezes.  If you can swing it, if you can score a west facing room with ocean views, I'd go for that.  Oh, the breakfast buffet was super lush, easily one of the best I've had in this region of the world.  Great hotel, you can't go wrong choosing it.","Date of stay: December 2015"

This is a lovely hotel having been refurbished to a very high standard. Our bedroom although a tad small was well appointed but would benefit from a second easy chair, the shower room was finished to a very high standard and the bed/pillows the most comfortable we have experienced in any hotel. Dinner in both the Seafood restaurant and The Harbour Court buffet were in our view exceptional and the breakfast was something to behold with a range and quality of food to suite everyone.

It is located right in the heart of Colombo and has easy access to shopping centres, amazing restaurants, the Galle Face beach and many more. Despite it being a very busy hotel, they offer maximum comfort in their accommodation sector. Food wise, they offer a fair variety of food but in recent times, High Tea at the Kingsbury has had a major down fall and it is quite evident for those who have visited the hotel just for their High Tea.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel!","Date of stay: November 2016"

The Ground and Lobby staff were so nice and helpful but the Sky Bar staff were all unreliable. - When we came in, no one welcomed us even though there were only a few people in the bar. - It took us several times calling the attention of the staff to get our orders or just to even give us a menu - When we sat there drinking, the guys on the other table moved to our table to chat etc, one of the guys asked the staff to give us a drink or ask us what we want for drinks, and i was shocked to hear the staff to say "" he doesn't want anything"".","Date of stay: November 2016"

Great roof top bar. Good clean rooms. Good restaurant options including western.   Be aware it is right next to a construction site which looks like it could go for a while. Some greenery and privacy around the pool would be nice.   Also Colombo isn't a 'go to' place for a holiday in Sri Lanka but that's not the Kingsbury's fault.

"Julie L","Great Business Hotel","The Kingsbury is a beautiful hotel on the shore overlooking the Indian Ocean. As it is in the city centre it is a big business hotel and as such does not have the warmth of a smaller establishment. The rooms and facilities are superb (we were upgraded due to celebrating a special birthday) and the suite was amazing.  If you have the time and it's not raining, visit the rooftop bar for drinks. The food was good quality and varied. I couldn't fault this hotel, however, if you are looking for a romantic stay, given what we'd experienced elsewhere in Sri Lanka, I wouldn't stay here if that's what you're looking for, though it is a beautiful hotel.","Date of stay: October 2016"

The staff were always attentive (and more often than not remembered your name and room number), and on the day we left they even arranged a packed breakfast ad we had to leave before the buffet opened.  Breakfast was very well stocked in the usual high end buffet style, with the standard continental options along with plenty of pastries and some interesting curry and meat options.

They treat guests as if we walk into their homes to stay. And then a smoking room floor where the whole hallway stinks of smoke which is not acceptable. Finally the most inexperienced waiters who don't know english neither know their job which clearly indicates staff are not hired from a hotel school neither previously experienced meaning its cheap labor. At the restaurant they served us boiling water to wash hands , when we asked for coffee we were served tea without sugar and milk. Again at checkout the staff don't even look at your face neither thank you for staying. Overall i wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone to visit except to visit","Date of stay: October 2016"

The Dutch Hospital complex is just across the road where there are shops and great restaurants which we preferred to the buffet offered at the hotel although this was also excellent.

During our last stay in Sri Lanka we did visit the Chinese restaurant at the Kingsbury. The food was excellent, the service great, and the bill? There were six of us, four adults and two teenagers. We had cocktails and mock tails, entrées, mains and desserts.

Overall service was excellent. The quality of amenities provided by this hotel is amazing. Room is bit smaller for a family with 1 year kid. The ambience of the hotel is good. The only down part is t that someone from the reception called to our room and said that they will provide us cake as it my daughter’s birthday, however since then we have not heard about it nothing was provided. This is something which is totally unacceptable from a hotel like this. Staffs are friendly and special thanks to Mr. Daminda","Date of stay: July 2016"
"Michelle H","Disappointing","We arrived after a long flight to the Hotel at 1.00am - only to be told they had overbooked and we would have to stay elsewhere for the first night.  This is despite our tour guide confirming the booking in person with them only days before our arrival.  We were then sent to an extremely average hotel for the night, although we were told it was also 5 star - it certainly was not.  We were then charged the FULL amount for both nights - although the hotel we were given for the first evening was advertised for nearly half the rate of The Kingsbury.   Being in the industry myself, I was understanding of the incident but was shocked that they charged us their rate after being moved at 1.00am and to a terrible hotel.  Very disappointed at the way this was handled and wont be returning.","Date of stay: August 2016"

"FLonTrip","Back again: Bad start but a very good continuation","We stayed at The Kingsbury in February and the stay was good. Thus we decided to come again.  We asked for an early checkin and we got confirmation. But when we arrived, that turned out to be a lie. Instead of an early checkin (we arrived at 11am), we needed to wait until 5pm (!!!) before our room was ready! They offered a tea for compensation, but that's ridiculous, right?!?  Thus, don't trust in commitments you get beforehand (last time we booked a limousine service but the booking got lost - so don't trust any commitments).  But the rest of the stay was very good: very nice breakfast, nice drinks, clean rooms. Thus, we are sure that we will come back - without any trust in commitments given by the hotel upfront....","Date of stay: August 2016"

When I was there, there were numerous events and weddings taking place, giving the hotel a lively feel.  The room is spacious and comfortable, with good amenities. The room I got had a sea-facing view which is gorgeous to watch the sunset from. However, my stay was not very restful due to limited soundproofing. I could hear neighbouring guests close their doors, walk down the corridors, and poolside party night activity (from where I was at the fifth floor). I don't mind it so much if it's before 10pm, but it's certainly startling when you hear a door ""thump"" at 2am because the next door closed their hotel room door. It would be great if the management could maybe invest in maybe a quiet self-closing door mechanism.","Date of stay: August 2016"

"stephaniecpp","Lobby feels like an event hall more than a hotel lobby","We stayed here for 4 nights. Everyday, the traffic at the lobby and lift is heavy.  Having only 2 lifts to serve hotel guests and banquet guests is just not practical.  This hotel seems to be a hot venue to host weddings.  We saw wedding couples and their guests everyday.  No complaints about the room and bathroom - the housekeeping team definitely gets a pat on their shoulders for a job well done every single day.  It would be better if the mattress is firmer.  Breakfast buffet is a scrumptious spread.  From International to Asian to Indian.  There is always more than something for everyone.  I was happy to get my first taste of their local Egg Hopper at the buffet line.  Pool is big and well kept.  Had a moment at the poolside but did not swim.","Date of stay: July 2016"

They had a wide spread of food available, from savoury to sweets and three different types of drinks available which I thought was great. It's good to give customers a lot of choice when it comes to these buffets and that they did. Very pleased with this High Tea and hope it stays this way!","Date of stay: July 2016"

Great seaside views, nice toiletries, great pool, comfortable beds, good wifi and plenty of cable tv channels as well. I am not sure why people complain about the breakfast buffet but the choices were fantastic especially the local fare, the tea and fruit choices. In the evenings the sky lounge is recommended.  Porter and front desk staff were regularly very courteous and helpful. They even allowed us a late check-out without much fuss.  However for such a big hotel, I still found that 2 elevators might be a bit slow on busy mornings and evenings.  A recommended hotel overall. Great stay once again.","Date of stay: June 2016"

Superbly located on the oceanfront and in the midst of hustle & bustle of a busy Metropolis ' The Kinsbury ' seemed the right hotel to wind up our holiday in Sri Lanka . It is an out an out city hotel with seemingly great patronising by the locals as well as expats along with the room guests .  We had an efficient check in and were upgraded to a Premium room on the 7th floor . The room had view of the Ocean but the construction was a spoiler . I was told that land was being reclaimed for a new Entertainment Zone which may take the sheen away from the hotel in the future .  The room was quite small but had all the requisite facilities . The bed was super comfy and one of the best hotel beds I have slept in . The toilet was really tiny though a lovely shower","Date of stay: May 2016"

The beach is just in front of, but currently under construction.  They can provide a car to pick up till the airport. Car are nice, but the mechanic is not very well... Vibrating above 90km/h...

Its very well situated and easy to access for travel within Colombo.  On the back side, there is a small complex which has some touristic shops, couple of Spa and restraunts. I also spotted a few Money Exchangers in that complex.  The hotel is 5 mins away from the best casino ""Bellagio"" and not very far from other casinos as well. (The casino pick and drop is free in hotel limo in case you confirm that you will play""  ->Room: On arrival, i was upgraded to the Suite room of the executive floor. The room was on 8th Floor and was very spacious. It had a separate bedroom and a big enough living room.

"Eirik K","Too busy to give attention","We had two night at this hotel in Presidential suite. We were quite disappointed about this stay. The website says that we will ""be treated like royalty"", but this service was not royal at all. Check-in took too long, no priority, not a warm welcome. Hardly anyone knew that we had the hotels best room. We could not get a proper table in the restaurant, or sky lounge. In executive floor we had to stay in the hall way or asked to take the food to our room.  Suite was clean and comfortable. Butler was a nice guy, but his appearance was missing.

The pool area and bar is very spacious and well kept, the public areas again are well maintained & spacious. There's also a roof top bar to watch the sun go down with a happy hour to match! The waow factor is the breakfast, I have never seen or experienced such an array of food, you could opt for a three course meal if desired, it's plentiful and very fresh and beautifully displayed. I enjoyed this hotel.","Date of stay: January 2016"

No real beach access, though. My suggestion is touring for a day or two, hire a tuc tuc. Most drivers are fluent English speakers and know the history of their country. Bargain and you can have an amazing tour, with the driver taking you to the sites you want to visit.","Date of stay: January 2016"
"Tess M","The rooms are tired","We stayed at the Kingsbury Hotel on our final night in Sri Lanka hoping to 'live it up' on our last night. The location also appealed to us since it was close to the Dutch Hospital and very central.   When we arrived in our room on the 7th floor, our first impressions were that the room was pokey and generally pretty tired looking. The furniture was chipped, carpet was old and there was paint chipping off the walls and also cracks. We were pretty disappointed given we'd used up almost a 1/3 of our credit card rewards points to stay there, but we realised it was just a matter of choosing an old hotel that was in need of refurbishment and there was nothing much we could do. After unpacking and showering, we began to notice how unclean the room was. There was mold on the roof in","Date of stay: January 2016"

It was recommended by a friend; so we thought we'll give it a try.  The Hotel is located virtually in the heart of the City Central, at the far City End of the Galle Face Green.  We were greeted by the door man with a beaming smile, which made us feel very welcome. The Reception area however, turned out to be pretty average. The reception staff on the day, were ""coldly"" efficient, but not overly friendly. The check in process however was efficient & business like and cannot be complained. We went up the elevator to the fifth floor & along a not so well lit passage to our room. The room itself was pretty small compared to the other major hotels we have stayed in.

It is very well located, right by the sea front, Galle Face Green, Fort area and Dutch Hospital Precinct. There are several of Colombo's attractions within easy distance in a tuk tuk or on foot. Many rooms have a splendid view over the ocean. The main restaurant is luxurious and we also recommend the pool bar which serves a range of casual foods at reasonable prices.

"MargaretJD","Not a good night - no sleep from ""boom boom""music","We were shifted 3 times tonight to 3 different rooms on the 9th floor. Finally! At 11.45pm we found some peace and quiet at last. This is not a place for comfort of the guests. They look more for income from functions, with bands blaring at both functions from both ends of the 10th floor.  No consideration was given to guests who need to rise early for airport transfers or early morning departures. Care needs to be taken when stepping into the pool and the tiles are precariously slippery when walking out. The positives, were the extensive choices of food dishes from the buffet for breakfast and dinner. The staff were helpful and considerate.","Date of stay: January 2016"

Everything worked well including Wi-Fi. We ate in the main buffet restaurant which was excellent value and choice/variety. It is an expensive place to stay (18th December) in high season. The hotel partly looks out onto an industrial port area, when this is finished maybe better screening will be in place. Would we return ....No we will not be returning to Sri Lanka, as we were ripped off on more than one occasion....Not at this hotel.

We informed that it wasn't the case and informed the staff that we have the booking confirmation clearly stating a double room. The person who claimed to be the manager informed that they will get a twin bedroom ready by 3 pm.  We called at 3 pm and the staff member informed that they will call back in 5 minutes. now it's almost 6 pm and no response.  There is a clear process issue of processing the reservation but there is a more severe case of attending what the guest has paid for.","Date of stay: January 2016"

The rooms were dirty - the lamp had never been dusted, cobwebs around the roof, shabby furniture.  someone had written in pencil on the wall and it was not cleaned in the 5 days i was there.  I complained about the room - moved to another where the housekeeping manager made a point of showing me the other rooms being cleaned -  but they obviously dont clean above the floor level.  The buffet selection was excellent but that was about it.  Hotel taxi overcharged us.

The room was very tastefully furnished with an European regalia look& feel and the view of Galle sea from the window was awesome. Staff was very helpful and polite and ensured we were welcomed well in their country. We had dinner at their Chinese restaurant Xche-Chuan which was indeed a good experience. The hotel's location - stone throw distance to the Old Dutch hospital and ofcourse the famed Ministry of Crab is an added advantage.

Bakery items were hot & soft. There were two varieties of soup. Main buffet had very good spread as well. Indian spread was good. There was a Chinese as well as a Sri Lankan spread. Yet again we enjoyed very much the Hoppers. There was also a barbecue section with all varieties. This was well marinated & fresh. In conclusion this buffet is great and simply Value for money.

We had a lovely open corner room overlooking the Indian Ocean. It was so lovely to wake up to this view in the morning.   The room itself was very spacious and clean. The bathroom was a decent size too. From what I can remember the bed was very comfortable.  As it was our last day in Sri Lanka we wanted to get the last bit of sun before heading back to London so spent most of the day by the pool. I think the infinity pool was the most impressive part of this hotel.   The buffet breakfast had a wide selection to choose from of Sri Lankan and international foods. All delicious!

"Junebughiker","Excellent Hotel in a Busy City","The Kingsbury is a very fine hotel in a very busy, crowded city.  The rooms are well furnished and clean and the hotel staff is extremely customer service oriented.  The morning buffet breakfast is very extensive with a huge variety of hot and cold and cooked to order foods.  There is definitely something for everyone.  Some of the rooms have views of the ocean. I stayed there on the way to Dambulla, so while it appeared that the hotel was conveniently located for business, it can take quite a bit of time to maneuver through the city and to the airports due to traffic during rush hour.","Date of stay: October 2015"

"Benjimab","Clarify happy hour rules in writing.","I went to the rooftop bar at the Kingsbury with my wife, on our honeymoon. We had a great night enjoying cocktails with a good view of Colombo. The barman informed us it was two for one cocktails 5-7pm so we had a few!! The disappointing part was they changed their definition of two for one when the bill arrived. Buy two of the same and get one free, rather than buy any two. When converted to Australian dollars the cocktails are still relatively cheap however I was disappointed with my suspected purposeful ambiguity from staff. I'd still go there again but lesson learnt.","Date of stay: November 2015"

Room very comfortable and well cleaned and presented.  Had to ask for a top sheet as the duvet/doona can get very hot.  Something that all Sri Lankan hotels probably need to take on board.

However, there are significant downsides. Although there is a lot of choice, the food is not as good as it nearest rival; some of the front of house staff (I hate to say this, but mostly the women) are surly and apart from one or two senior managers, those in the restaurants need training.

The 7th floor has a nagging garbage dump stench coming from the service exit door. It's so bad you think you're walking next to a garbage truck. The guests coming to attend the million weddings are so loud. Now, my final feedback is the noise. Coming from India, where hotels don't allow loud music after 10pm or at least if they do, you can't hear a peep in the rooms, Here, the marriage hall is on the 10th floor where the music is thumping and you can hear it on all the floors.

The buffet breakfast and dinner as well as the fish restaurant were superb. However, the attention to detail is missing. The staff were disinterested and really couldn't be bothered. Not sure if they needed more training or just motivating but they were a glum bunch. We are friendly and always make conversation but they didn't seem to care for engaging or being friendly. The other problem was the noise, they played loud music at the pool until late and we complained on two occasions. I must add they gave us 50% discount on one of the three nights we were there but I'd rather have had a quiet evening as the children were tired.

We told them we will go back to Colombo on our last day to pick up the jackets.    Guess what, when we went back to the hotel, the hotel said they cannot find them. I don't really expect such things happened in luxury hotel.  And if it happened, the management should do/ say something about it.  But nothing happened.  The same thing happened in another hotel we stayed in Bentota.  But the manager there reacts promptly and gave a good apology.  That makes the difference.  Another thing to beware is the pool.

Check in took 20 mins, only 3 staff in reception, and the hotel was extremely busy. We ordered food from the pool cafe and my order came 10 mins after my husbands. We ordered a pot of tea, which was forgotten and we had to go and find a member of staff and order again.

Food (Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner) was really good - no complaints on that. We found the rooms quiet clean but very small and cramped up with too many things put in one room, while for such a hotel it could have been a bit more spacious. Room service / House keeping were all kind enough to serve us and support us in every way.  It was an okay experience, I'd say - not extremely good and not bad either!  P.S.

One of the terminals were broken and while I was checking in ano the guest came and made a fuss about his room and they all fell at his feet so I was left waiting again. Lots of people on check in with no professionalism.   Rooms were very small, basic and dated. Housing keeping guys are all fab as are the staff at the pool.

Intially i try to book the hall and got the children party package, while i went there to pay the advance, they informed that they stoped this package, i was really disappointed and not even a sorry from the section, actually they could call me before go there and inform about this problem.

I know when you have an amazing or terrible experience, you just want to let someone know; but my experience with Kingsbury was so disgusting, that I just kept giving the hotel chances, hoping that something would change. IT DIDN'T! My experience is over 1.5 years, and trust me if you are thinking of hosting an event here, my review is a MUST READ!  I have summarised my experiences for all of you.  Early 2013: Made a booking for the Balmoral (Ballroom) for 450-500 pax. I was in constant conversation with a gentleman by the name Rizvi.

I was astonished to be woken up at 7am on Sunday by building works.  I am very disappointed that the hotel has not advised guests that at the back - seafront end of the hotel - there is a small road, and across it rocks are being moved to create a large building project across a large expanse of the seafront.

That was rectified without asking so great service.   We lounged around the pool. Service was attentive. We had a couple of massages, again service was good. Needed those knots kneaded out of our necks and backs.   We had dinner at Ocean. Seafood was great and we indulged. The breakfast buffet was opulent and wide ranging.

Bad things: do not look at the details as the renovation has been made quickly. The lobby is busy, noisy with good buffets all around making the impression we are in court food rather than an hotel.
