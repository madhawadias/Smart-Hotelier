The outside area of the restaurant is little smaller than other restaurants although the food was delicious and surved by extremely professional manner. Staff was highly polite and helpful and took very good care of us since beginning to the end of our dine. A special thank should go the hotel for inventing new herbal handwash to it's guests. The herbal handwas made by using Sri Lankan herb plant - ""Iramusu"" was very good and for me it was really nicer than the chemical handwashes. Thank you shangrila for making our day a remarkable one. Definitely the one of bests in Sri Lanka."

On arrival all the staff were very welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable.  Great cocktails and lovely Champagne at reasonable 5 star prices. Dinner was delicious with large portions, great presentation and service. When I mentioned I could not eat dairy the chef came to our table to discuss my menu choices which gave me confidence that they understood my dietary requirements. Our waiter Kavindu was excellent and we enjoyed his professional and friendly service. After dinner we stayed to enjoy the music in the bar which was also a really good high standard.

From Dj Ruki to the management and staff, they have really offered a five star service every time we visit Kaemasutra. The staff here at Kaemasutra is the main reason why we are regulars. Much appreciation to Michael (manager) Dulaj, Ashane, Jagath, Shehan and Kalana are amazing! Nowhere else in Colombo offers the welcome they showcase. As a hotelier, I give a big thanks to the management as their work ethics reflect on how their staff mirror Service toward guests.   Kudos towards the management and staff at Kaemasutra! We will always be regulars because of the staff!!"	Date of stay: February 2020DuxieCanada	"All I can say is ""wow"" !!!!"	"We were lucky enough to be upgrade to an executive floor at this hotel.

I have done many flights to Colombo as a cabin crew but this was my first stay in Shangri-La Colombo. In many other hotels we don’t get much attention may be because we are cabin crew (glorified waitresses) . I met this incredible gentleman at check in Mr.Hashan who comes from cabin crew background. He is simply amazing and yet very professional. When I did not like my room and returned back to lobby hashan did not ignore me. He was very kind enough to change the room and took time to check on us till we leave the hotel.  I have noticed he is very friendly with every customer who walk cross the lobby. The hotel has a good selection of restaurants. I wish I was there to explore all restaurants. The housekeeping staff were very nice.

The first room we were given smelt musty, it was a corner room. Upon reporting it, we were swiftly moved to another room without any fuss.   We wanted to relax and not rush on the final part of our holiday and we were able to do that. Using the gym, pool and even booked in for a massage as well.   The Horizon Club benefits were soo good that you could pretty much eat in the lounge and not have to go to the restaurants at all. We did go out to eat in the steak restaurant downstairs and in the mall just for a bit of variety.   The staff were attentive, polite and courteous and asked if we had everything we needed.

The facilities are immaculate, the location is great, the food is excellent and most of all, the staff is as good as it gets.   The manager, Radinki (believe correct spelling) made such a difference in our trip. Despite having a full hotel due to a conference, she made us feel as though we were the only guests there. We ended up having to unexpectedly stay another night, and she saved the day."

It’s very expensive overall and airport pick-up and drop off is 4-5 times that of Uber. It becomes a bit ridiculous. I will stay here again because of its location and classy property but I feel it’s more of a business hotel than a relaxing resort/vacation property. Hoping they can maintain this level, minimum, otherwise this property will be overpriced. I recommend the rooms that have balconies."

Another lifetime memory was our last night at the bar with live music.

Only thing the hotel should add is Airport pick up and drop (at least for the Suite). This is done by major hotels.

The suite we had was lovely and spacious and had a balcony which was nice. The bathrooms are large and luxurious. The staff are very courteous and friendly. We did have an issue with our room and some lack of communication regarding this. Feedback was addressed promptly by the higher management and made us feel as our complaint didn’t just fall on deaf ears which is always a risk in large hotels. Breakfast and horizon club was great and having horizon club access was excellent as it gives you breakfast, a light lunch if you want it, afternoon tea and canapés/drinks in the evening.

(this is 10 times the normal rate per hour in SL and Valet Parking is a free service in Sri Lanka as part of the hospitality industry).  When the concern was raised was told that this is a VALUE ADDED Service.  In other words, Shangri La is not a welcoming place.  This is not the first times the hotel tried to fleece unsuspecting customers.  As they opened they sold normal fish buns and other buns for exorbitant prices which shocked the Colombo community.  Guests are advised to check the rates stated and unstated before they avail themselves of the hotel services. To say the least the charging practices are totally unethical."

We were in a Horizon Club level room and the staff across all parts of the hotel were very attentive and provided us with excellent service.  We were made to feel at home and very comfortable throughout our long stay at the hotel.   Here are a few staff members that went above and beyond the call of duty: Chef - Vipula De Silva who always came by during breakfast to see if everything we needed was available and a shout out to the other team members in"	Date of stay: November 2019Rufdhi B			Chandel S			CYRIL H	Place to have a diferent meals	"We went for a dinner at Capital  bar and Grill. Lovely ambience. Good friendly staff, Good drinks and Music, But some of the dishes and not up to the Shangri-La standard. If they can improve. This is the place that can compete with any other."

Dumbells go up to a decent 40kg, and they have a squat rack and a functional cable machine, in addition to all the usual stuff.  Service is top-notch, and security was extra tight, due to the recent bombings there, so we felt very safe. The only problem we had was that the room was very dark and gloomy.  Other that this, we had a fantastic trip, and will definitely return here again."

The amount spent on the buffet was so reasonable and the taste of the food was awesome. The spacious dining area was great and had a lovable experience there. I visited the table one restaurant before the easter attack and hope the hotel has successfully recovered from the blast.

To begin with Anushka Rajakaruna was extremely helpful, efficient and accommodating. I would like to thank her. I would also like to thank Mindika the operations manager for his super coordination. The chef too needs a mention and has to be complemented on the food. It was not only tasty but also presented well.

The room looked new, was spacious and very well presented. There are some little things that just always annoy me in hotels and non of these were present here. The room is actually designed to accommodate two people, unlike most - even in suites. When you walk in there was a small powder room on one side and a beautiful walk in robe on the other. It had space for 2 suitcases (which is something that is always missing) and enough hangers for 2 people to hang their clothes (I usually always have to ask for more hangers). The robe opens to a great bathroom with lots of towels, and yes room to hang more than one used towel. The amenities are lovely and there are lots of them."

The staff are exceptionally warm and hospitable.  The rooms are large and nicely appointed.   We had access to the club lounge on the 32nd floor and it’s very nice.  We were able to eat all our meals there.    It’s unfortunate indeed that people who consider themselves to be world travellers would be put off by the recent terrorist incident in Sri Lanka.   The hotel occupancy has been down since then in spite of the fact that tragic events can occur anywhere at anytime.   After our stay here we continued a tour of several other destinations in the country, found the people to be friendly and welcoming and have enjoyed the country immensely."

Located right on the Galle face with a breathtaking view of Indian Ocean adds that much more enjoyment to the stay. Right from the check-in which was efficiently handled by Radhinka, to the daily interactions with the concierge, and the highly delectable food created by the sous chef Murugesan made our stay all the more enjoyable.

I travel frequently across countries. At times I found a hotel of Shangri la standard so poor in service. It seems they are more like one of those 3-4 star hotels when it comes to service and quality. Unfortunately there are not many quality options for frequent flyers in the area so one has to stay. But my sense is once the other ones come up soon, I am sure this hotel will be one of those where people would stay only if they don’t find a place."

My query is as to why such a renowned chain of hotels is now asking for payment for a simple service such as valet parking especially when customers are entering the hotel.  The concept of validated parking was available previously but it seems like this is not present anymore.  I do not think other five star hotels in Colombo request payment for valet parking. Please check on this.	Date of stay: October 2019Conrad De La Motte	Visit's to Shangri-La	"I happen to be a regular visitor for high tea at this hotel.

Focus is only on monetary gains and not the customer’s needs and requests.  I had my wedding reception at this hotel on 20th July 2019.  The reservation for the ballroom was made in July 2018.  In spite of having paid an advance and the reservation confirmed, Ms Shamista Ganeshan called us while we were abroad (on work matter) asking us if we were using the ballroom on the 20th morning as there was another party interest in using it.  She said that if we did not pay for the full day of the 20th, the hall would be given to the other party in the morning.

Gym was lovely with everything needed and the swimming pool warm.   the only thing if I had to find something to point out (not moan about), would be that the club lounge should have access to snacks throughout the day/evening. It was annoying to get in from work, go the dinner and then not be able to go back and have a coffee, cake for example. Snacks were taken away by 1930!

The staff exudes a genuine warmth rarely found in South Asian hotels. They seemed happy in their jobs and eager to help without being overly pressuring guests. Smiles were ever present.

The room was beautifully appointed, although there was a slight damp smell that seemed to slightly disappear through use of the air conditioning.  We had a great time in one of the pool cabanas, sipping on cocktails and snacking on dishes from the poolside menu. The pool is the perfect space to enjoy the Sri Lankan sun and truly relax.  We didn't eat breakfast or dinner at the hotel, as there are so many great restaurant options in Colombo including: Ministry of Crab (the prawns in garlic chilli sauce were so good we went twice), Upali's (don't be overwhelmed by the menu, the curries are fresh and delicious), Café Kumbuk (delicious brunch and worth a short uber trip), and Jam Roll (literally the best"	Date of stay: March 2019Ted E			Tokushev	Guest during Colombo bombings	"We have been In Shangri-La Colombo during Eastern bombings.

As a Jade member we were really looked after from the moment we checked in and were ultimately able to really enjoy our stay in Colombo.  We were greatly saddened by the tragic events that happened at both hotels a few weeks after we stayed at them, and our thoughts are with Sri Lanka and everyone affected.

Location is in Galle Face which is near the Dutch hotel i.e. full of history also quite close to Ministry of Crab.  With all the construction work going on at the port, it's better to stay in a room facing lake side than seaside as its not pleasant and certainly not worth the extra. Despite all the excavation work going on we did not hear any noise from the room. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom of decent size and functional, except we found the toiletries with very strong jasmine fragrance.   Breakfast had a lot of variety but most of Sri Lankan dishes were a little hot for us.

We booked an ocean facing room and got ocean glimpses, we were looking from the side of the hotel over the construction next door and could see Galle Face Green, this was a little disappointing.  There is a lot of construction going on around the hotel, we could hear hammering at the construction next door to the hotel from 7.30am.

Ordered drinks, dinner and dessert and after having finished dinner, kept trying to get the attention of the waiters who were too busy cleaning glasses. Had to go up to 2 different waiters and tell them to send the dessert and bill. Even after this, had to get up and go tell another one to send the bill again. It’s pointless repeating the rehearsed lines of “is the meal okay” etc if you are simply not attentive and don’t really care. Terrible Service.

We were given an early check in which was really well received as we had just endured and overnight flight.  We decided to pay the $20 upgrade to get access to the lounge and we really weren't disappointed, they put on an amazing buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner!  The other great thing was the view from our room, if you can get a room overlooking the sea, it's really worth it."

Great atmosphere to work and all the meeting rooms are equipped with hi-tech gadgets so that you don't have to worry about anything else. In fact, I forgot to bring my MacBook charger one day and was thinking how on earth I'm going to continue my work. When I informed the staff that I need to go back home to pick up my charger, they very kindly provided me a MacBook charger (they seem to have all types of laptop chargers, cables etc.).

The service is impeccable and being a new hotel everything is absolutely spotless. I've been to the spa, gym and pool, all were great.  Info for vegans: My only negative is with the food. The room service menu compared to other shangri-la hotels is not that great and the vegan options are limited. I also wouldn't recommend the dinner buffet as there really isn't a great deal of choice."

The hotel is flooded by Colombo's elite during all hours of the day and is a busy place for Weddings and Engagements.   Too many business meetings take place in the Breakfast Lounge thus removing the relaxed holiday feel you desire. Would be an option to create a bigger area for the Breakfast and Dinner buffet (it's already quite spacious).

We went there for a family and friends get together, and also to experience the newest addition to the Colombo hotel scene. We were genuinely underwhelmed by the experience. The lobby decor although being shinny was generic, with no affiliation to the country it is in. As far as the Table One restaurant is concerned, the service was good, although the food variety and more importantly the taste was mediocre at best. The only decent bit of the buffet (priced at Rs 3,000+) was the desserts, where they had managed to pull-off a proper cheesecake, as opposed to the gelatinous nonsense that other 5 star hotels in Colombo offer.

We were extremely surprised with lobby decorations and amazing ginger bread house which spread seasonal spirits all over the lobby. Special thank to the Hasan (was in stunning traditional dress) who went beyond our expectations. He offered a wheelchair for my Aunt as she is quite old. Not only that he was genuine enough to operate the wheelchair all the way to buffet restaurant. The restaurant was busy and staff were really helpful. Also a big thank to Chef Kalpa. One of the best buffet spread in Colombo.	Date of stay: December 2018The_Bananas	First Shangri-la Experience	"We stayed at Shangri-la during our short stay in Colombo. Hotel has a great location and amazing view from the room. The rooms AND the l hotel itself are very neat and beautiful. We felt very comfortable and staff took a good care of us.  Breakfast is really good with a great selection. One evening we had dinner in Chinese restaurant and it was amazing! Great atmosphere and delicious duck. Another dinner we had in Capitol Grill. Drinks at the bar were delightful, the food and service side could be better. As well as in the lobby lounge where the service was quite slow.   Overall it was a lovely stay and we would consider to come back on our next trip to Colombo."

A brand new, and very comfortable hotel, but the difference was the service.  Having left in the morning for the middle of Sri Lanka, we discovered an IPad had been left in the room. Being 6 hrs away, we contacted the hotel who had found the IPad - but we struggled to understand how we could have it delivered to our next accommodation.  The choice appeared to be between a US$250 car or a much cheaper Express Post Service - that needed cash upfront!   However, solved at very little cost, as the hotel simply asked a staff member holidaying near us to bring it to our hotel.    Possibly just lucky - but the Shangri-La made that luck"	Date of stay: December 2018Rukshan T	Sapphyr Lounge	Sapphyr lounge outside zone is the perfect area to chillout with some coffee and friends.

"I stayed at Shangri-La Colombo during my first ever trip to Sri Lanka and the stay has been absolutely amazing and successful. Starting with the meet & greet at the airport and really well informed chauffeur who brought us to the hotel (in a Landrover)! The arrival was smooth and impressive through a very professional team at reception (paperless check in) and a really impressive festive decoration throughout the hotel. The overall stay was really superb and among the best experience I can recommend are: a) the dining at ""Table One"" is absolutely fantastic and conducting some work, both focus & creative at the ""CONNECT"" co-working space feels good and inspiring!

The rooms at the Shangri-La are tiny and are missing a work desk. The tiny space in front of the TV doesn't constitute as one.  Golden Circle elite treatment is non-existent. My upgrade was supposedly to a room with a fantastic evening view that had didn't have any kind of view at night.  Sheraton is about to open and Ritz-Carlton is being built. This is very poor showing from Shangri-La and I'm back at the Hilton when back in Colombo.

We had a lovely room and the facilities were excellent.  We spent the day by the pool which was lovely and ate at the Kaema Sutra restaurant in the evening which was very good. Shangri la hotels never disappoint!   The breakfast is something else, the range of options is huge!   We were even treated to a bottle of wine and cake as honeymoon gifts in our room and were given some tea gifts on departure, which was so sweet."

He was a very descent and gentle man, he strikes just the right balance of being unobstructive yet friendly, and familiar at the same time. I felt home at such an unfamiliar place, all because of such good staff members."	Date of stay: November 2018Superally2007			mpc737	Great hub for exploring Colombo.	"This was my first time staying at a Shangri-La property. Although I'm familiar with the brand, the opportunity had never come up to stay at one of their hotels. This was also my first time visiting Sri Lanka, and I'd read some great reviews regarding this hotel. The hotel is spotless, and in a great location for exploring all that Colombo has to offer. The real standout for me was how friendly and accommodating all of the staff were. I'd like to give a special nod to Dulaj Lakshitha, who works as a fitness coach, at what is probably one of the best hotel gyms that I've ever seen. I was sore from traveling so much, and trying to keep on top of my exercise regime. Dulaj was great to workout with, and is a stretching expert.

The Horizons lounge offers free drinks and canapés for two hours from 17:30 each day.  The one thing that sets this hotel apart from other five star hotels around the world ... the staff.

With pools, gym, spa etc. Moreover the hotel faces the sea across an unpolluted and non-contaminated beach. Blue waters of the Indian ocean lap the water's edge. Great views from a 32 storeyed structure. Though I doubt you could get to the water as some reclamation level activity is on. But great for walks and jogs.  Lunch and dinner were part of the package so can't comment on that. It's slightly pricey. However serves 3 times the amenities compared to a hotel in any part of the world at the same cost.

A must being the French Onion Soup in Capital Grill. The bar staff in Kaema Sutra (particularly Dulag), Captital Bar and the Pool Bar were the best. Anything requested, whether on the menu or not, they executed perfectly. All in all I would thoroughly recommend the Shangri La Hotel.

He was a true hotelier and his service was faultless. I cannot thank him enough for making my stay truly memorable. The service received from this truly magnificent hotel will never be forgotten.

They have an excellent restaurant called kaemasutra where the squid ink hoppers are a must try. Service however could have been a lot better. They were unable to help us rent a car and would make no recommendations or provide any information on getting the permits necessary to self drive in Sri Lanka.

We've used the chain before (in Toronto) but it's not our first choice for luxury hotel. After this experience we might need to re-think that. We chose a room with access to the private lounge, which was spacious and had a good selection of complementary food and drinks. The food was excellent but sadly the complementary wines on offer were very poor; not at all suitable for a luxury hotel. Luckily, though, the Bloody Marys were excellent, so we weren't complaining too much.  The hotel is nicely located on the waterfront and in a historic part of town.

Their coordination and continuous support was great until wedding. Mr. Nireksha was very supportive and they offered us personalized service for us. everything was in our comfort zone unlike other hotels have many restrictions. We were offered a food tasting session before the wedding. cannot complain anything about their food as well. we spent our beautiful evening at their complementary honeymoon-suite which was luxurious and we are privileged to be there too.   It is better to get advice and come to an agreement about the photo locations inside of the hotel before your function.

It is newly opened and the staff are all well trained with most of them joining from other good hotels.   The gym is first class and the pool more than adequate. The breakfast is of a very good standard. The bedrooms a decent size although all very uniform.   One downside is it does overlook all of the work currently being done to reclaim land for further investment in Colombo, however it can’t be heard and the quality of the hotel more than covers for this."

In the final analysis it is the staff that make or break the establishment all things being equal.  Otherwise the rooms were more than competent, the facilities good. The pool decent sized.

I think for me though the thing that made it stand out the most was the genuine and warmth hospitality of the staff - this extended to all areas from concierge to the room attendants as well as in all Food and beverage outlets. A big thank you to Sachin in the horizon club who was most helpful in planning some of our tourist activities and dining experience whilst in Colombo. The position of the hotel is great too and close to restaurants as well as the ocean which is a huge attraction. I look forward to returning soon.

I use this hotel each time I’m in Colombo on business.   The staff however seem to be incentivised by gaining tip advisor reviews, and proactively seek them out. I disagree with this practice, although Kavidu Theekshana will probably not be rewarded for his excellent manner.

The location of this hotel is great, you may walk along the beach within 4 mins to enjoy the view and have some foods at the Bazaar. Mini mart also walkable from the hotel.

I visited the hotel when it first opened last year. As an avid traveler and a person who visits a lot of new properties this Shangri La is one of the most boring places I've been to. I was in the country on a business trip staying with family (motherland is Sri Lanka) and came to know the opening and wanted to go see what the fuss was about and of course to know what the hotel had to offer. At first I must say the location is quite nice. Perched on top of a hill overlooking the sea, for Colombo and those who have sea facing rooms great location.

Use Horizon club	"Pay the extra to use Horizon Club services. We didn’t have breakfast there often because the buffet downstairs was bigger and had more selection. But we did use the Horizon Club concierge a lot. They booked all our tours and dinner reservations for us. This saves the hassle of wondering what type of tour you are going to get and saves you the hassle of trying to call all the different places. Sachin in the Club was a great service and helped us a lot on this trip.

While the choice is many and really plentiful, some local delicacies like hoppers and steamed idiappams dont look fresh, though they are hot, you can see the dried corners and it looks like re-heated stuff.

From the moment we stepped in, we were treated to a superlative experience in service from the likes of Andrew, Devin and Rajitha.  Nothing seemed too much and I must commend the level of attention they paid to the guests. This set the tone for what proved to be a great dining experience with an excellent choice at the international buffet. The variety was great but I felt the meats in the western section bordered on bland. Whether that was intentional given the range of sauces, I have no idea. However this is my personal preference.

Service during the dinner was exceptional compared to the experience at other restaurants in the hotel during previous visits. The staff was paying attention to the guests needs all the time, where most of the guests were Europeans and Americans along with South Asians.

Rooms are comfortable with great beds but I found the rooms a bit tight for  two people.   Bathroom is large but be very careful in the shower   The floor is extremely slippery when wet.  Nice view of the water but the Chinese are “creating” an island that will have a casino, mega hotel and other “attractions” that will block some of the views. It’s a very busy place with lots of activity.  The breakfast buffet was akin to walking the streets of New York during rush hour.   I thought the prices were a bit high in the lobby restaurant.

The performance of the front desk staff and associated management is lacking significantly, and even after 4 days/3 nights and multiple reminders, several of my questions remain unanswered.  As one example, printing a 1 page eVisa for my next stop involved many calls and conversations over 2 days, and when assured it was fixed, printing a 1 page airline eTicket on my final evening resulted in exactly the same void.

"Fabulous stay from start to finish!!!!Booked a suite for 3 ppl and was upgraded to 1 brm apartment overlooking the ocean on the 10th floor. This came with an early Checkin and access to exec lounge.Spacious apt with all the amenities such as dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, microwave, large fridge/freezer, and Nespresso machine. Serviced twice a day with turn down. Bathroom had sep rain shower and bathtub with sep toilet. Staff were extremely attentive, friendly and accommodating. One example of this was when my son commented on fresh coconut water (thambili), the manager on duty arranged for fresh “thambili” to be sent to our room.The breakfast buffet was superb. Unlike other 5star hotels we stayed at - the menu options changed daily so we were spoilt for choice."

The lobby is very welcoming and the views from the lobby are getting better as the gardens around the Hotel are growing and blooming adding to the atmosphere of the Hotel. The staff were also very courteous and hospitable. However, as we experienced the first time we went to the Lobby last year as the hotel was opened, the presentation of the drinks and food was not quite measuring up to a 5 star hotel. It may be small matter but details matter, especially in an establishment of this caliber. Example being drinks coming without garnish such as lime wedges etc. Hotel will do well to pamper the guests little bit more."

Every curtesy was received from all staff. We ate in the Table One restaurant several times. Kudos to our server, Charith Rangana-he did everything with excellence on the first two meals. However, on our third visit, we were seated in a different area of the restaurant and wound up with a broken table and had to move. The issue was resolved. But, we expected the staff to check equipment. Overall: we would highly recommend the hotel. The table is the reason for “4” rating."

The property looked smart and modern, with lots of marble, panoranomic glass windows and high ceilings.   Regarding the staff,  while they were by no means terrible, on a couple of occasion the service fell short of what one would expect at a top city hotel - as I presume this Shangri-La is positioning itself to be.   On the first night a false emergency alarm went off, with an annoucement suggesting something more nefarious than a fire. While there was a follow-up announcement apologizing for the mishap, the fact that the receptionist sounded noticeably annoyed when I called to double-check five minutes later was regrettable - yes she was likely bombarded with other calls, but only as a result"	Date of stay: March 2018Bugles	Second stay...massive improvement from January in service	"This was my second stay at the Shangri La.

I reserved a kind bedroom however on both ocassions the reception told me I had booked a twin room. Also I was told that I would be signed up for the Golden circle on my first visit but I never received anything.

The familiar Shangrila aroma you smell in every Shangrila around the world reminded us of home.  We requested for a room on a higher floor & check-in was kind enough to arrange for it.  Our room 2308 was comfy & cosy and served our needs. Housekeeping was very diligent in keeping our room clean & well-stocked.

That said, their recently opened Colombo destination feels like it has been rushed.  The whole complex is still very much in development with 2 towers and a large podium mall still in construction. The completed tower feels like the finishes haven't been at the highest quality that you'd normally expect from a Shangri-La destination (finishes peeling in the lift, hotel lobby lacking in dramatic punch, carpets and corridors decidedly average, etc).   The balcony and outdoor areas suffer from the hotel's proximity to the port city reclamation project.  Whilst impressive to view, it does add to the dust/smog/haze in an already over polluted city.

Breakfast was very tasty offering tons of options from both traditional Sri Lankan cuisine and western cuisine, but the service was lacking.  You had to flag someone down for a refill of tea/coffee and empty plates were rarely cleared from the table.  The pool is beautiful.  But the pool service was spotty at best.

Service was also not all that great since the guy who was in charge of our section did not even smile or thank us when we left. but that's not all that important we go for the food and its taste not for the beauty of the restaurant and its ambiance. felt like paying 3300 per head for the ambiance alone! nothing taken in terms of food so frustrated! hate the place"	Date of stay: February 2018Shevantha Perera			Sudarshanruwan	The attenive servic and the best lobby	Had a really awasome evening with the friends having evening snack at the lobby.

Took like 45 mins to check-in.  Also, they took over an hour to bring my bags to the room.  I had to call to request them.  The bed is not that great and they have limited movie channels.  Minibar is so overpriced.  Breakfast is horrible at this hotel.  Most disgusting breakfast.  Was expecting much more from Shangri-La.  When I checked out they took forever.  The guy was so dumb couldn't even count.  Gave me my receipt without an envelope.  To top it off, I had to carry my own bags out to the taxi.  How disrespectful.  Such lazy door staff.  I had to call 3 times to get them to come and polish my shoes.  They take forever to get anything done in this hotel.

But this time in Colombo this was a real catastrophe. The hotel is well located and is a nice property. This is just about the positive. Service is far below par. Extremely slow and inefficient in restaurants. Service of the room inconsistant. Customer care not really visible. It looks like you’re here to give your money and should be happy to be there, irrespectively of the quality of service. There are other good hotels in Colombo and other ones like the Hyatt to come soon, so unless you want to be disappointed, just pass your way."

Usually big corporate chain hotels are all the same the world over. Even though this place is big and modern we didn't feel it was soulless. It's funky with a relaxed vibe and friendly and polite staff (as all people in Sri Lanka seem to be). The food and drinks were really good in all the restaurants (although at breakfast the tea has that yucky tea/coffee taste). Hubby said the massage he had in the spa was one of the best he's had. We had a sea view room which was lovely (although with all the land reclamation going on I doubt there will be any rooms with a view soon.)

She offered us a table away from the windows which seemed ridiculous when they were all free and not reserved. The waiters were all very courteous & charming and there were plenty of them around.

We reached there around 9 30 PM and at entry we were told that the buffet will close at 10 30 PM to which we agreed .But, from the moment we took our seats and ordered a glass of wine we were constantly reminded by each and every staff that passed by regarding the closing time almost to the point of harassment. We complained to the steward but his answer was"" health regulations"" The spread was good but spoilt buy the constant hurry up slogan and finally to make matters worse there was no choice of ice cream available for dessert.

I was frankly a little taken aback by the in-room coffee (sachets of Nescafé!) and tea selections - pathetic for a hotel that charges a very hefty premium over the other 5-star properties in Colombo. The Spa Ceylon bath amenities are not very high quality either. More than anything, the staff were not at all at the level expected of a Shangri La property - they appeared inexperienced, unsure how to execute minor tasks during check-in and check-out (asking colleagues for help, for instance). We needed a taxi and it seemed like I had asked the Bellman to bring me the moon -"	Date of stay: February 2018Chanaka D	😊😊😊	"Shangir La Colombo is a wonderful hotel.

Surprisingly also there is no mirror on the dressing table, actually the hotel call this a writing desk.  So if you want to plug in hair straighteners you must use this in the bathroom, but there is no plug socket in here, that we could find.  I think a man designed this room.

In fact, when I mentioned that the air conditioning was too much for me, he produced a woollen shawl to drape around my shoulders! That is true service. The starters were many, varied and tasty as were the different main courses on offer. The prawns were large and fresh, there was food of different countries well presented and delicious.

I've eaten at Kaema Sutra and Table One. The latter is as you'd expect from a 5-star hotel buffet restaurant - very good. The former is disappointing. I would advise anyone to get in a taxi and go try proper Sri Lankan food from somewhere such as Upalis, Nuga Gama (Cinnamon Grand), or a random roadside 'hotel'. Failing that, make friends with a Sri Lankan and they'll make you go to their house to eat their home-cooked Sri Lankan food - it blows this out of the water."

He was really helpful and well mannered. As im also working in customer service industry I know how hard it’s to be always with a smile. But he did it effortlessly. Well done Mr. Sampath.

However, I have been patronizing the Sapphire lounge to  catch up with my friends few times . At first I assumed the great lapses in regard to basic services  were due to the fact the place was newly open and lack of trained staff . However to my dismay during my visit to the sapphire lounge late last evening with friends around 11.30pm for a quick bite , desserts and coffee, the same poor quality service was apparent .

Could not find a seat in the oriental restaurant. Managed to speak to manager and get a table at the buffet.

The rooms was perfect, with every amenity you could ask for in a bathroom. Shangri-La is a wonderful chain, and you won't be disappointed with your stay.

The artificial flora and fauna is out of green plastic and depicts a dessert resort (eg Saudi Arabia).  Even hotels in the middle east do not have artificial greenery.  The inside of the hotel has the typical looks of an Indian atmosphere although Chinese owned.  It looks like the House of Fashion - all lit up with nothing special.  The entrance to the Table One Restaurant was not a pleasant sight with all the fresh fruits stacked in the area.  The scene is as if you are entering the Economic Development Centre in Dambulla.

Great views over the ocean or city. Pool area is large, but if hotel full wonder if all the sun beds will go. pool is large enough to have a good swim. Not sure about the yellow sun beds, but time will tell.  Gym very good, and has every thing you need for a good work out. Plenty for eating and drinking areas. Very good location can walk to a lot of attractions and along the ocean front.

A huge team of Shangri-la managers from different properties were sent in to help open the hotel so the service was always pretty good when you dealt with them. The pool and gym are great. The Chinese restaurant is best in great.  The cons: The place still feels a bit like a tourist site for locals. A lot of people coming in to take pictures and to have a look around.

"The hotel had literally just opened its doors when we visited the first time - the second day of operations - yet everything ran very smoothly and we did not encounter the usual hiccups that would be expected of a brand new hotel. The staff are top notch and make the experience what it is. They are courteous and professional, and you can feel a strong sense of pride in being part of this long-awaited opening. No request is too small, and I have had 2 Duty Managers go far beyond expected service, to find me the information that i was looking for.  The rooms are bright, clean and very well appointed. A lovely touch is a fixed table by the window, with it's own plug so that one can sit and observe the view (we had a gorgeous ocean view) whilst working, rather than face the usual"	Date of stay: November 2017Amila S			Nuwan Jayawickrama	Anniversary Outing	"Awesome hotel and beyond the five star experience. Staff is super friendly and flowers were arranged for the anniversary. Table One Restaurant is just amazing with the staff being so attentive to detail. Excellent and I’m sure this hotel knowing its reputation around the world will be above the rest of the hotels in Colombo, and Sri Lanka. Hope the other hotels could follow the motto Shangri La has. Well done guys."	Date of stay: December 2017Nilmini W	Nice ambience and great service at Table One	"Visited Table One for a dinner buffet. There was a wide variety of food and dessert to choose from, all of which tasted great. Staff from the entrance, lobby and restaurant were friendly, courteous and helpful. One thing though, the juices were abysmal. The orange juice was unbelievably bitter and the passion fruit watered down. The roof top has an excellent view of the Colombo skyline."

Oh, what an awesome hotel it is, the moment we got off our vehicle, we were ushered in the doorway with a greeting full of hospitality and once we entered, the beautiful hostess gave us a warm and friendly welcome. The hotel is very spacious with a large and serene coffee shop, which has a breath taking view of the Galle Face and the upcoming Port City.  Although we wanted to try their lunch buffet, it was full up and finally we had to opt to have some snacks and coffee at the Coffee Shop at the Lobby.  But the atmosphere is so relaxing that we didnt feel the time passing by and the snacks served were also fresh and nice.

In particular, Chris and Rushdi who were very friendly and helpful. The hotel was only recently opened. And like any newly opened hotels, there is room for improvement.

Their warm attentiveness and caring makes a customer to visit the place again. The food is delicious and had a good choice of all kinds. The place itself is lovely and price of the buffet is reasonable. A Lovely experience.

The Hotel is phantastic, beautiful and classy.  But the service is horrible, it seems utterly unorganized (especially the Sapphyr Lounge). After 45 min we managed to place an order, that never arrived, the waiter was not to be seen again...After ordering again with a waitress, we received our order (few items were not available). All around us people were complaining. One waiter passing our table was cursing rather unpolite...Paying the bill was another challenge, the waitress who took care of us was not to be seen anymore, we were wondering where all of them disappeared? After receiving the bill from yet another waitress, it was wrong....We have been visting Hotels"	Date of stay: November 2017HughAdvisor	Too many issues	Buffet is very ordinary.

But this is an international brand and is normally first class, 5 star material.  So, we met an amazing guy on reception called Ravi. He could not have been more helpful and competent. He even upgraded us to a 1 bedroom apartment. So the start of the vacation was as good as it gets.  The Club room wasn't open yet and they offered us the option to have the same drinks & snacks in their Sapphire Lounge. Trouble is the waiting staff didn't seem to know. Oops!

Hotel was not equipped to cater to larger number of guest.  When requested for bread roll, wait staff mentioned ""sorry they  are out of it"" and to exhibit there sophistication hotel decided to serve alcoholic beverages to the table.  Oh boy, that too they screwed up.  I had to walk to the bar and get are own drinks.  The food was bland!!  No taste what's so ever!!  In short the hotel screwed up on the sit down. We decided to stay over at the hotel!!  Rooms were good and with excellent view!!  Its virtually impossible to reach the Guest relations or front desk!!

Date of stay: November 2017Chinthaka004	Room for improvement	"Visited the lobby restaurant at Shangri-la Colombo on Saturday evening. First impression and greeting was great but took time to come and take the order. From that point, it was all down hill. Food and drinks took a long time to come. Food quality was decent. However, getting the attention of a waiter was challenging. After a number of attempts to get the bill, finally got the bill, only to realize that we had been overcharged. Again, with the greatest difficulty, managed to point this out to a waiter who took it back to correct it. Had to wait for almost half hour and remind 2 waiters subsequently, just to get the corrected Bill. With a delay of this nature and overcharging, expected at least a genuine apology rather than a plastic one. Very poor service recovery.

Definitely lives up to the Shangri La brand.  Highlight is definitely the high tea in the lobby.

If you visit this restaurant during noon, be sure to get a table away from the glare of the sun :) They would close the blinds if you request them to. First off, they did not get us water till we asked? After placing the order for food, we waited for an hour for the curries and an additional 45 mins after for the rice to arrive. The starters were sent as soon as the order was placed and were very tasty. We were quite angry since it was a Tuesday and had other engagements to attend to.

Guess it was the banquet entrance. Was wondering why, coz it was not so congested. At any given time the Cinnamon Grand entrance has more traffic!!  Never mind that no welcoming feeling, walked up to the Bar for a drink, was quite full but there was a table for 2 available. The head waiter or manager who was running like a hen without a head rushed to say that no food can be served before even greeting us. It was 23:30 and we just wanted to have a nightcap. Finally I pulled a chair and the 3 of us took a seat.  The Bar is nice but nothing to write home about.

When I billed the muffin was available but when we were sorting out our bill the same person who took my order gave away the last blueberry muffin to another person who billed after me. Thereafter I was offered a chocolate chip muffin for free. Also they didn't not have proper containers for take away orders.   The staffs are very negligent and lacks hospitality.

The architecture is very tasteful.  However, the main entrance of the property doesn't live up to the Asian ambience and the expected welcome.   Perhaps due to the novelty experience the Table One dining restaurant was full last night. However, the food quality was very disappointing. Under cooked shrimp on the grill, half done hoppers, smelly water tumblers, incorrect table layout are a few that comes to mind.   Staff were clearly inexperienced and didn't live up to the star class expectations.   Here's hoping that they will pull their act together and deliver what the customer pays to gain. Will look out for reviews before the next visit.   All the best!"	Date of stay: November 2017ashanthimendis	Super...Weekend dinner.	Souch value for money..had the best selection of food and great service...even though it was the opening week..every little detail was looked into. We were at the table one restaurant.  The only.hitch was that the dessert bar was a let down. No ice cream only sorbet. All cakey desserts..  Other than that the buffet was great. Service even better.
