Beware not to expect the restaurant to open on Saturdays or Sundays . Food is only served on those days in the roof top bar and the menu was limited.

Nice rooftop bar for food/drinks. Nice rooms, very comfy beds. Reasonably priced. Would definitely recommend.

Also one of the coolest temples is also 5 mins walk way.",Date of stay: February 2020Vishal M,A decent business hotel with a good view,Our stay at Ozo was fairly decent. The hotel had a European business hotel vibe to it. It is located in the famed Marine Drive locality. The interiors had a Scandinavian minimalist vibe which we quite liked. Something that definitely surprised us is the absence of a concierge or bellboy to help us with our luggage....we did struggle quiet a bit with it to say the least. The food was decent and the restaurant view was pretty nice. The rooms though small were pretty nice and stuck to the brand color palette to the T. The rooftop bar rates were pretty affordable compared to other rooftop bars. Would definitely love to stay again....guest service could be improved by a bit!,Date of stay: February 2020Sushil,Fantastic Stay,I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and found it extremely comfortable. It is a self service hotel so I had to take the luggage myself to my room. Other than that everything was just right. The room window looks over the ocean and gives a very soothing effect. Rooms are very clean and comfortable. The size is a little small though but you do not feel cramped. Location is plus as for late night eating there are food trucks nearby on marine drive. Swimming pool is on the roof giving a beautiful view. I would love to stay again.,Alok S,A second home for me,"I have been coming to Ozo Colombo for quite some time and never felt the need to look out for options. The reason is the homeliness I feel here with people, surrounding and services.  All the team members are very very pleasant and welcome smilingly.  The ocean view from the rooms is amazing , refresh you.  The team at reception / front desk / customer relation is wonderful, friendly, cooperative  (Bishan, Mandeera, Bhanuka, Kuhanjith, Nalin, Sameera, Angelo ++) . The team at Eat ( restaurant) is very friendly  ( Champi, Thameera ++) .  All in all, a place worth experiencing in Colombo to stay.

Sorry if I",Date of stay: February 2020Majd S,"Great beds, average service","We slept there for one night, the check in took too long maybe because we arrived at night and the pick up arranged from the airport was late.

Nice views",Date of stay: September 2019namita2020,Good Business Hotel in Colombo,I stayed at OZO for 4 nights in Feb 2020. Needed an early check-in and airport pick up was was met as per my expectations. The best thing about this property is location. Very close to the Marine Drive and if you book an Ocean Facing room on higher floor then the view is stunning with the Indian Ocean and the sunset. The rooms are pretty basic in terms of supplies and decor. However it does not make a big difference as the room cleanliness is maintained well. I think it's very important to practice sustainability and be enviroment concious in whichever country you are. I liked the way there were no unwanted supplies. The rooftop restaurant is another place you can spend your evening for a drink or even have dinner though there is limited menu option which I did not find,Recep Aydin,,,Mahdi A,Excellent service,Nice view.

The bed is super comfortable, the curtains are blackout, so sleep quality is great. The rooms and corridors are carpeted. The bath has only a liquid soap and shampoo in dispensers fixed to the wall, no other toiletries are provided.

We found this hotel to be surprisingly good and far exceeded some of the 5* hotels we had stopped at in India. The room was spacious with a beautiful sea view, nice clean modern bathroom, and an amazing roof top terrace. We had a cocktail and watched the sun go down over the Indian ocean. Dinner was good too with a buffet of varied Sri Lankan specialities. There was an egg station at breakfast and fresh fruit and pastries so that suited us but there were also curried dishes if you preferred that. It is a good hotel location wise - we managed to fit in a half day tour of the city and the hotel was well located for that. I wish we could have stayed another day to explore the beaches too.",Date of stay: January 2020Vasu88,Good hotel for holiday stay. Not suitable for Business travellers.,Pros - Good location.

The rooftop bar area is nice, with a nice area to sit at a table and have a drink. There is a small infinity pool up there which doesn’t have much space around it, it is basically in the bar, but it does the job for a quick dip.

Between two of us we had 5 luggage’s but like other hotels they didn’t have a luggage porter where they will bring the luggage’s up in check in or bring down for check out, so that was a disadvantage. Me and my sister struggled a lot to take it up and bring it down so maybe a wheely luggage carrier and a dedicated porter would be very helpful.

That was a BIG mistake. The conversion done is at the rate set up Sri Lanka Hotels Corporation and it is so much higher - I ended up by paying about 35% more which really took away from the stay.

I'll begin with the room, we stayed in what the hotel describes as a dream twin room so we got a view of the ocean and city, which gives the eyes something to watch if stood or sat around a few minutes. It was also a great place to watch the many lightning shows the city has to offer. In regards to the room itself, it wasnt the biggest I've stayed in, but it was manageable, enough room to put what you had away, you just had to think about it.

It overlooked the Indian Ocean and we were on the 11th floor.  Staff left us standing in reception while they chatted to other people who did not seem to be guests. So an average welcome.  We enjoyed an evening of lotus roots and lion beer overlooking the Colombo skyline which was a little like New York in a funny way. The bar is pricey and small lion beers are $4 ..when you find out they are as little as $1.25 in a shop outside the hotel its not good value.  Good: Views of Indian ocean only and railway line.  Breakfast reasonable and the hopper chef was lovely.  Not good: Room seriously damp smelling and entertainment will keep you awake until 1:30am.

Compared to the resorts that we stayed in earlier, we saw the curtness of the staff, plastic smiles, 'speaking just about enough', more suited for Business Travellers. First of all, there was some miscommunication between our travel booking agent and the Hotel in terms of what all was covered for 1 night. The hotel took some time to clear this confusion. Check in took some time but in a leisurely trip, we were not really rushed for time. It is important to note that we stayed in 5 more properties before that including Taj Bentota and Jetwing Yala, and nowhere this confusion with the travel agent had happened.)

The hotel is located quite some distance from the main restaurants in Colombo so there is hardly any dining options around the hotel itself, which might be an issue for some, but not for us as we wanted more of a remote location. However there is a tuk tuk service that can take you to the main hustle and bustle areas if needed. The room was spacious and the amenities were of a decent standard.  We had dinner at the hotel on their rooftop garden and the prices were reasonable for hotels as they come. There was a good choice of dishes on the menu too.

The positives: Really efficient front desk - check in and check out usually quick and usually error free. The only times that there have been problems has been when coaches of tourists arrive at the same time - but you have to be unlucky to be around when that happens. Rooms are modern and well designed - but colours used are a bit muted, which probably means that they feel a little drab and don't photograph well. But really nice views from Ocean front rooms. It's a fairly new hotel - but there are signs that maintenance isn't as good as it should be - this is most evident in the bathrooms e.g. tiles in the shower have signs of mildew growth - its a pity as a bit of effort in housekeeping would really improve the experience of staying",Date of stay: July 2018Hasi,,,joween2018,comfy and simple hotel,everything is cool all basic needs and expectation of the hotel are meet. nice comfy stay as usual :)however toothbrushes and slippers are not provided which is a little disappointed on this. will get if hotel look into this area,Muhammad Tareen,Nice place to stay,"Ozo is one of the best places in Colombo,Sri Lanka, to stay.

The reservation folks who responded to my email about our visit and my daughters birthday mentioned they will make the day most memorable....! no body remembered the day.

We ate in the pool bar on both nights - the food was okay hotel food, but the pizza and burger offerings could have been a bit more Sri Lankan.

Breakfast has a full array of options, Western and Sri Lankan. The staff was quite courteous and helpful. I also think the hotel did a good job hosting our meeting of 80+ people. I would stay there again for businesss purposes. The rooftop bar, however, is a bit more of a party scene.",pasupathym2017,Great experience,"Enjoyed the good ambience, the sea view from the room, efficient services, cleanliness everywhere, complimentary breakfast buffet with a good spread.

As a repeat guest one can feel the F&B Service needs improvement. Check In, CheckOut, transfers, Taxi Service, Housekeeping, Public Area cleanliness are wonderful too. I notice some of the Front Office staff did not have their name badges. So this is something you should improve on.  Public toilets need more often clean rounds than a scheduled one as I noticed the toilet at the lobby area is mostly dirty  Bell Service, Luggage Assistant Team, is always friendly. Palitha is an excellent staff.  During Dinner buffet I found the Shelving Dishes cover handle is too hot, you should have a piece of cloth or napkins so as to ensure one doesn't burn him/herself.

Room’s temperature was hard to control due to poor air conditioning system. It doesn’t have any patio to have the fresh air. Bathroom amenities was poorly managed, no tooth brush and tooth paste was there, though after complaining they provided it. It doesn’t have any menu book for ordering food at the room, they have installed it in the TV which I didn’t like at all. Very few choices of food for serving in the room. The glasses they provide to drink water were not clean. Not worthy stay for the amount of money they charge.  Only thing we like was the bed. The mattress and the cushions are really comfortable to sleep.",Randy N,,,339dilinis,Sleep Overs,"Comfortable all round with good food!

Bedroom and bathroom are spacious and modern - bed and pillows excellent.  Good selection of European and Sri Lankan food at the breakfast buffet. This hotel is located approx 6kms from the city centre on the coast.  For travel into the city centre, I recommend using Uber. Tuk Tuks in Colombo are to be avoided because we found many drivers looking to overcharge tourists.  In summary,  Ozo Colombo is a good quality hotel at a reasonable price.

Further to that I emailed them confirming above and requesting pricing for their breakfast as their website links did not work. Out of all the hotels we reserved and emailed this was the only one which never replied.

Rooms are very clean and comfortable and restaurant has a great breakfast buffet. 'beachfront location' could be misinterpreted as whilst it's right by the sea you have to cross train tracks to reach it and it's just rocks, so you can't sunbathe there. There is however a nice rooftop bar with pool that enjoys beautiful sunny sets. I was there two consecutive Fridays at the start and end of a tour. The first one was dreadful. Some sort of teenage version of Sri Lanka's got talent on the rooftop bar til 1am. So many kids that hotel residents couldn't use the bar.

Sadly it is located on the beach road buy with a railway line between road and sea, Thus a walk to the beach is not possible and the staff recommend a 1.8 Km walk to a proper beach.  The problem that we experienced was that the chef uses far too much salt and the food is therefore n0t good. Add to that some terribly tough beef and limited vegetables for the buffet dinner and we were not delighted by the feast. To damn it all together coffee with dinner was at extra cost.

I was staying three nights and the experience was truly disappointing. The room was small, with very poor seaview. The minibar was empty, and the fridge out of order. No safe in the room, a lack of bathroom Equipment, also no Information according Wifi - you have to ask for temporary vouchers. The room was cleaned daily at 5pm in poor quality. The breakfast was alright, and the breakfast-team is offering fresh orange juice or coffee whichout saying that extra costs are involved. The fitness studio on the rooftop is small but alright. The bar on the rooftop offers cocktails and food with poor service, because service charge is added automatically. Therefore it takes at least 10min to get the bill.

The hotel is a fine basic business hotel  Staff is friendly and attentive.  The breakfast buffet was fine. We also used their car service and that was good.  The reason for the low rating is the noise at night. Our first night we were awakened by loud noises at 2am. The hotel staff was using the stairs to transport times to the top of the hotel for a big dance party the next night. It took a couple phone calls but we got them to stop.  The next night was the big dance party from 5pm to 3 am. The hotel was kind enough to move us to a lower floor, but the music could still be heard.

However a few rundowns like imperfect location - Market / shopping areas are little far. The hotel is little overly priced in terms of services rendered. One very negative point is that I found the drinks offered in the roof top bar were diluted by the bar tenders with little or no taste and are overly priced with the quality of service offered.

My biggest issue though, was that the hotel has, I'm guessing at least 100 rooms and on the roof where the pool is there were 4 sun beds. This is ridiculous, we asked if there were any more but that was all they had. The alternative is to sit at normal chairs and tables which isn't practice when you get out of the pool.

The rooftop pool is beautiful as well offering great 360 degree views of Colombo and the ocean. Our room was quiet and clean and a good size.   The location is a bit far from the major attractions in Colombo, and you need to take the tuktuks (about Rs500 from Dutch Hospital).

Don't use the hotel taxi which charges 1500 LKR for the same trip. Drinks in the hotel bar were, in my opinion, exorbitant at nearly 1500 LKR for 2 small draft beers.

The reception staff appeared to be either new or trainees, and weren't prompt in general or accurate in settling our bill. The location of the hotel itself is pretty good, as it is a stone's throw from the Indian Ocean and a short distance from the Galle. The food was a let down.

There is no storage in the main living area at all. There is a small wardrobe in the bathroom. Not sure it's a great idea to have clothes hanging in the steamy environment of the bathroom.

Other than that: GREAT modern new hotel that I would 100% recommend.",Date of stay: December 2014Furqan,Nice place to stay,"We stayed here as a group of 10 people at the end of December 2014. The over all ambience of Ozo is very classy and modern with a relaxing feel to it. The location is very convenient as there is a rocky beach just across the road, restaurants on both sides of the hotel and two train stations on walking distance as well. The reception staff is very helpful and courteous.   We spent a fun night on the rooftop bar as the hotel had arranged a event which was free for guests. The drinks in the bar were rather expensive but the ambience was good with an excellent view.   The rooms are very comfy and modern with everything you need. There was power sockets on both sides of the bed and I haven't seen many hotels which do that :)",Date of stay: December 2014ferdi1486,great!,"I spent 3 nights at the hotel.  the hotel is relatively new.  nice comfortable bed, good water pressure (nice shower room!).  the rooftop is great...a perfect place to watch the sunset and the trains.  lots of food choices whether its breakfast or dinner...Ozo Colombo is simply great!",Date of stay: December 2014Jessie N,,,PLonsdale850,Could be so-much better,"It is a new hotel which is nice and clean, rooms are a little small but adequate but the biggest let-down for this hotel is the pool area and roof-top bar, it's trying to be a hip night-spot for Colombo's young & trendy scene, which is fine if that's what you want, if you are after a quiet relaxing drink in the evening then give this hotel a miss, Dance music blearing out of the bar's many speakers will nearly deafen you and if you happen to have a room on the top couple of floors the music can be heard",Date of stay: December 2014Matt_Howo,Great clean rooms - get the view!,"The hotel is great.

Nice meeting rooms, nice rooms, nice and friendly service, always eager to assist, nice food at breakfast and lunch (both large choice buffets), nice room top cafe, nice views. Rooms are clean and very comfortable. You do not hear your neighbors as in other hotels - they made a real effort here. Avoid however 12th floor as you might hear slightly the music of the roof top cafe and the 3rd floor if there is a party on the 2nd floor.  The only suggestions for improvement I would have is to install an ATM machine in the entrance, get the aircon in the meeting rooms improved to have a constant temperature, and probably give the option to have only a bed sheet instead of a blanket in order to avoid to use the aircon extensively (be",Date of stay: December 2014RugbyFan78,Drinks at the Roof top Bar,The roof top bar area was well laid out with a small pool.

Design and Function aer obviously high on their adgenda.  Located on Marine Drive, not really close to anything but there is a hotel taxi service and plenty of cheap TukTuk's passing by.  Checking in and out is not straight forward but they are charming about it and bend over backwards to help. One of our Party did not have their passport or ID card with them. They still allowed check in providing a fax copy arrived during the stay. So make sure you have either or at least a driving license if you are a local.  Rooms are light and well appointed. Every thing you need. Views of the sea at the front of the hotel. None of the rooms have outside space so its a bit boxed in.

When we arrived we stayed at the OZO in Colombo which was a great choice. As although this is not a cheap backpacking accommodation, it is a really clean modern hotel and great for recovering after a long flight. The price at the time was also very reasonable compared to western counterparts, so it was worth the indulgence before hitting the road to Kandy.",Date of stay: August 2014John W,Cant get a drink after 7pm sir...your in shorts,"Booked in as visiting Colombo to watch England play cricket,2 night's now and another 2 at the end of our stay.Went out for a meal this evening and when returning and entering the rooftop bar,was told as I had shorts on I couldn't stay there......but I am a resident I said.....it matters not it appears....it would appear we are catering for those who are not residents more than those that are....nowhere,and trust me I've asked and looked,does it say I needed trousers to have a drink after 7pm.....and to be honest,why should I,I'm on holiday,and I quote 'Ozo is a place to chill out and unwind, but presumably being on holiday in my shorts,which is how I choose to unwind is not acceptable.....I'm seeing the Manager in the morning,meanwhile I'll listen to the din of the party on the",Date of stay: December 2014PaulinVence,Customer service lacking,"Basically good but a few points… Wifi sometimes unobtainable on the 11th floor. When possible very slow even for downloading email and almost no better on the ground floor. There are too many staff, few of whom take responsibility. In the restaurant at breakfast food had been spilled on the floor. The waiters walked around it. In the top floor bar there had been a party the night before but rubbish was left below the pool the next evening. In the restaurant they served chicken when my wife ordered fish, we complained, waiter took it back and said that it was fish but would make a fresh one. When the fresh one arrived it was fish. We showed the waiter the difference as my wife kept a pice of the chicken on her plate. He was embarassed. They have not understood that",Date of stay: November 2014Cat P,"Really clean, modern hotel","I stayed at OZO on my first night in Sri Lanka with my husband and parents. It's an extremely modern hotel with really nice sea views. Unfortunately our rooms weren't ready on arrival, which was pretty late, but they offered us a complimentary drink at the bar. Rooms are fully kitted out and the bathrooms are lovely. Buffet dinner was lovely too. Not the place to stay if your looking for traditional Sri Lankan decor but otherwise a very pleasant stay.",Date of stay: November 2014angelak456,"nice hotel, pool amd rooftop bar are lovely!","My husband & I stayed one night. Late checkout (2pm) wasn't an issue, with us later deciding to extend until 9pm because of late outbound flight, an additional half day charge which wasn't an issue. Breakfast was nice, rooftop bar and pool are worth a look, swim and drink; we also had an afternoon snack and the food was good. The hotel is opposite the ocean but swimming isnt really an option (in our opinion), stick to the pool! The hotel can organise airport transfers although a bit expensive, we organised a taxi and that was easy enough.",Date of stay: November 2014Lasith Perera,Simply Awesome!,"Got to know about the place through a friend. Was a party of seven, came here at 8pm on the 3rd of dec 2014. Being an F&B executive at Jetwing hotels I had expextations. Was a awesome team lead my Mr. Ravi the restaurant supervisor.  Flawless service by Mr Ishan who took care of our table. Sold the new flavor full swiss pizza through well worded suggestive selling methods so we bought it.

They spell the word hospitality a little differently the spell it as hostility. We where booked in this hotel by our business associates and we took the hotel pick up facility. After reaching the hotel at around 8.30 am through an early morning flight we were told that the check in time is 2 pm and they would not be able to release a room before that. I have travelled around 32 countries across the world and have never experienced such hostility. After a lot of prodding the reception guy asked us for half day tariff to release the room early, which we bluntly refused. We were given a lecture on how it would result in a loss of revenue to the hotel. Finally we were told that room cannot be released before 10 am.

Since itis new everything looks nice and sophisticated. However the service people look bit clueless when a guest appears. May be they are also in a training period. The food was just average. Could have introduced good variety with a good taste rather than having a usual menu if they really want t thrive from all the hotels restaurants that are opening everywhere in Colombo.,Date of stay: October 2014Monujesh Borooah,"Modern Convenience, Serene Ocean","The OZO, Colombo was the venue of the Engineering Tomorrow conference of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, UK. I was a delegate.  The hotel is attractively modern, with an ocean view that is compelling. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. The cuisine is varied to suit different tastes. It is a little away from the city centre yet close enough not to make it inconvenient.  The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, in particular the people at the reception.

The three night stay was enjoyable, with comfortable rooms and exceptionally good food catering for most tastes (limited vegetarian options). OZO is a new hotel with spacious, well-appointed rooms offering an ocean view if you get one at the front. The staff were attentive and tried hard to impress during my stay. Hope the Hotel Team take note of the small number of minor negative comments and act on them constructively.   OZO brings a breath of fresh air to the Colombo hotel market.",Date of stay: October 2014Supun P,Nothing significant,"Nothing significant about the hotel when compared to other rooftop bars in colombo.

I was very happy with the room and got one with the sea view! We had space for meetings and also time to relax at the rooftop where the view is amazing!

Good modern room with comfy bed, and good business hotel type breakfast. Down side, pillows too big and parking of vehicles of residents outside, exposed to the elements.
