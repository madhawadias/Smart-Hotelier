LornaWatson,Pleasant stay,"I was a bit dubious about this hotel having read some of the reviews, but went ahead as was only one night and it was very reasonable, in fact cheap.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The room was clean and comfortable, the staff were all helpful and pleasant.  I had an enjoyable drink and very nice dinner with superb views in the rooftop bar and restaurant.  What more do you need for a stopover in a very convenient central location?  I would have no hesitation staying here again.",Date of stay: February 2020
cabeysiriwardhane,Theme Night - Valentine Gala Dinner,One of the best Theme night we have visited. One of the best senary of Colombo harbor.  The arrangement of the restaurant was excellent. The Buffet and the spread have been arranged in a beautiful manner.,Date of stay: February 2020
Speranzasf,Please lower your expectations - avoid 4th floor,"The BUILDING is iconic but the hotel is just a basic roof to stay in Colombo if you just need shelter for 1 night and you are on a limited budget.  PLEASE avoid 4th floor. This is a hotel with an old floor plan design so there is not back hallways meaning that housekeeping,  banquets and culinary trolleys and carts will be pushed all day and NIGHT through the guestrooms hallways on this floor. The reason is because the meeting rooms are on this floor and if there are functions there will be a parade of trolleys as long as the functions last including at night. When I stayed at GOH there was a police gathering reunion (evening function) in one of the meeting rooms and the event ended by midnight so the trolleys and carts were back and forth until 2am! I stayed in room 428.  Good",Date of stay: February 2020
Megan F,"Great stay, as expected","The hotel was in a great location. It was easy to walk everywhere. The room was fine. The hotel is a bit run down, but the old colonial charm makes up for it. We had a good stay. The breakfast was nice, but expensive. We were there on a holiday, and it was the only option, so it was even better! If you expect 5 star, this hotel will disappoint, but as a room and shower, it was great. We would stay again.",Date of stay: February 2020

LibbyDevon,An authentic Sri Lankan experience,"We stayed at the GOH from Saturday 25th Jan until Monday 27th and were charmed. This is an historical location, right where travellers docked and gained their first impressions of 'Ceylon'. Having flown in overnight we were greeted with courtesy and a welcome drink, and shown to a clean, quiet spacious room. Certainly the decor is a little tired, but it's got bunches of character. If you want to go to a swanky could be anywhere in the world establishment, and pay 4x as much go ahead. The staff at the GOH were charming and made our stay a pleasure. Would thoroughly recommend to those discerning enough to appreciate the old world style. Well done GOH !",Date of stay: January 2020

ravi g,Old style charm - very much dated,A colonial era hotel in Downtown colombo facing the harbor. Everything seems a bit dated but the staff make an effort to keep it prim and running .

Madara Perera,NEEDS A MAJOR FACELIFT..,"Past glory...this place is really tired and old. I do not understand why the management still not doing anything or planing to go for an immediate renovation.. They need it badly.... Just damped and humid walls, and smells due to that I think.  Also they need to change from the furnishing to the staff visibility at earliest possible. I think being an old and heritage became super marketing trend but the look and feel of this hotel only rely on past glory. they can do more and do a facelift to keep their old colonial grand look and the same time city luxury with no fail on maintenance. We love this place as its most iconic here in the city, but in a situation like this unfortunately we can not recommend for anyone anymore  except the feeling of historic and amazing architecture",Date of stay: August 2019

Guruyb,Fantastic heritiage hotel,The location of the hotel cant be anything better. its located infront of the colombo port and next to the police head quarters. Its a very old hotel one of the landmarks during its day. it manages to retain the hertitage look and great value for money.  i have given 4 stars as the room is old and requires immediate renovation. but for the price you pay its more than worth it.  I would highly recommend this place,Date of stay: July 2019

Camila Ogawa | Japarioca ________,Old and smelly,"The hotel has more than hundred years history. Mustêve been an iconic place in the past, but nowadays itês only too outdated. Iêve stayed in hotels with long history before, this one has no charm on it. When we arrived a security guy checked our bags (I believe it started since the sad incident that happened this year), he opens our bags and check it using his hands. Itês not really effective and can be unpleasant. One of the things that I noticed since my arrival was the smell of the place. It smells old and humid, might not be a good choice for people with allergies or respiratory sensitivity. My room was also quite smelly and the smell quite stays in your clothes and hair. The room was outdated but ok, the bed was two twin bed together and can be uncomfortable for couples",Date of stay: August 2019

Coffee was decent, though unsurprisingly pricey",Date of stay: March 2019
OntarioTrekker,Grand old hotel that needs serious updating.,I just stayed one night prior to a cruise but would not recommend a longer stay since the harbour area is not attractive or perhaps safe.

martin v,old charm with very good service,"It was our hotel for the first and last nights of our trip. Located in the heart of Colombo Fort, the grand dame recalls a previous era which is its charm. In room 341, the hot water takes awhile but eventually gets there. The AC unit's condensation leaks in the corner of the room., be sure not to put anything underneath that must not get wet. The Saturday and Sunday buffets in the 4th floor restaurant were excellent with a wide variety to choose from.  There is a Spa facility, also on the 4th floor but didn't see any mention of it in the room. There is a small museum ( a small room) on the 4th floor but unfortunately it is locked. You can look through the glass doors to see some old artifacts.",Date of stay: March 2019
GermanFelix,Good for one night to be nearby train station,"We stayed our first night here, easy 15 min walk from the Fort train station where also the local bus from the airport finishes. We received a nice welcome juice. The hotel looks to have had a great past but no investments for a long time. There is a cheap local restaurant nearby recommended on tripadvisor and used by many locals: Fort Pillawoos (not the cleanest but okay if you are hungry). The hotel works well as an option for the early train to Kandy the next morning due to its proximity to the train station. The area around has also seen better days. Tuktuk drivers hang around the entrance in case you donêt fancy to walk.",Date of stay: March 2019
ShvRm_Traveller,Dated. Looks much better in photos,"This is an iconic hotel located adjacent to Colombo Port gate, housed inside a historic colonial building. The hotel looks great in photos in comparison to the actual condition. The hotel is located on street which is very busy during the day, but deserted at night. The building shares space with the surrounding building, most of which are build during colonial times. The area as well as the hotel building appears quiet impressive from the outside. From inside the building shows its age. The rooms, the passage ways, the lobby, etc are all spacious with high ceiling. It appears that, the timely maintenance of the building is being carried out however, the new repairs does not blend with the original interiors. Being an aged building, there is limit to which the modern amenities",Date of stay: May 2018
Gary the Pirate,Beautiful glimpse of the past,"I spent a week at the start and a day at the end of an epic visit to Sri Lanka. The GOH is big and correspondingly so are the rooms.

Craig L,A Colonial Gem,"In my travels I make an effort to seek out these old Empire era hotels and this is the first time I had stayed at the GOH. Following the old patterns this was built adjacent to the old port and Customs House and it does not disappoint. In the heart of old Colombo it is a step back in time and one can almost feel the presence of the bygone era in the foyer.   The rooms are a spacious and are a bit dogeared, but that is part of the charm. I believe the GOH is government run, but the staff do a wonderful job and are attentive. Given its location the prices are relatively reasonable.  I am not a buffet type person, but admittedly they do a wonderful job for all 3 meals and usually you can get a table overlooking the port complex.   It can get a bit noisy in the hallways if you have",Date of stay: February 2019

As the other reviews tend to suggest - youêll either love it or hate it.  At the discounted rate we paid, it was a bargain to stay at somewhere so historic and iconic.

Food very good, staff very helpful and happy, working lifts, prime location and near lots of restaurants and pubs and has a great bar in the hotel itself.

My Tropical Journal,Nice Hotel with an Old Look,"One of the oldest hotels in the heart of Colombo with an easy access to many prime locations. The property was a colonial bungalow built by a Dutch governor in 1837.  Being one of the modern hotel in former era, today it definitely need a facelifting.   Clean tidy rooms look dated  in comparison to other hotel rooms in the area. Furniture, interior and other amenities need an upgrade. Manageable for one or two nights but may not be enjoyable someone looking for a longer stay.   Tasty buffet had a nice spread. There is a small pastry hut to grab quick snacks. Staff is friendly and supportive.    Overall nice experience if rooms were up-to standards.",Date of stay: November 2018

Kerry,Grand old Dame.,"Mixed review for this hotel, certainly a piece of history in Colombo.  Hotel has a lift, the service from staff very good.  The foyer has a lot of atmosphere as do the corridors of this hotel if you talk a walk around and look.   My room had a glimpse of the port, not as noisey as I thought I would be.  My room was basic but comfortable. Being an old hotel it is difficult to ""upgrade"" to give modern amenities.    Could do with some 'bleach' in the bathroom to get rid of mould.  WIndows opened!  The restaurant was definitely worth eating in.  Food and service was excellent.  I don't smoke but went out on the balcony from the restaurant has stunning views.

glen b,First time visitors to Sri Lanka must stay here!,"This hotel is an important part of Colombo's history. It is amazing. Sure it's in a bit of a time warp, but it is obvious it was a grand hotel in it's time and still offers great value for money. It is not expensive. The view from the dining room is fantastic, even better on the outside balcony adjacent to the dining room. We were there during New Year's Eve celebrations, great timing, as the staff turned out a great night with fabulous decorations, great music, dancing and memorable food. The rooms are very large with four poster beds and ensuite bathrooms.

One of the oldest Hotels in Colombo I think. You have to check with them for food festivals and man O' man the food is off the charts with good selection. International buffet is not the best though. Reasonably priced and great staff. Speak to Anil. The friendly guy i always deal with on my reservations. I am a regular. Oh during festival dinners the music is magnificent.

When was the last time you've seen a CRT tv in a room with analog like reception. The worst is you won't get any sleep because of the noise.   Second, the location is in a seedy part of town.

That mild music radios to wake you up in the morning reminds you of the old and classic hotels about which you just get to read nowadays. 6.

This is a very old hotel and the inside was obvious- worn down rooms with small black old school TVs. Itês very dated and the bathroom is clean, but looks untidy with the worn look. Staff friendly and the breakfast was pretty decent with a good variety- especially the omelette station. Cooked really well and tasted good. WiFi was the best out of the hotels I stayed at and the walls are paper thin!

It was the last hotel of the tour and was certainly the low light of the week by far.   Our group of 10 arrived at 5.30pm and we had a pre arranged booking through the Trip A Deal Tour. However, our group were kept waiting for over 40 minutes for our keys to be issued. None of the staff seemed to know what was going on, and most were frantically making telephone calls. And then my wife and I were told our room still was not ready and we would have to wait a little while longer.

We were fortunate enough to be given one of the two suits at the hotel, a huge room with a four poster bed, draped with lace curtains. The room was once used by the author, Anton Chekov.

There were sofas, chairs, table and a serious TV - then the huge four-poster bed - beautiful, far too opulent for me, but I'll take it.  The bathroom large too, granite tops, very spacious, however when you turned the shower on the shower fell from its bracket - every time! - needs a bit of work.

When we asked if they hotel can book train tickets ahead of time because we knew we were traveling in high season and seated tickets were difficult to get, the hotel responded that they could not help and gave a website to the train company with no option to buy tickets.   2.

The ascent to the harbour room  at the top of the building is exciting as  one can use the ancient lift has been well preserved .  Inspite of the obvious lack of resources to upkeep this hotel, the management is doing a remarkable job arranging theme nights and lavish buffet dinners and lunches with live music.   There is a wide choice of dishes  representative of various cultures including Sri Lanka. The latter includes a hopper station which is popular",Date of stay: November 2017
Azurian,A bit disappointing.,"We really love staying in old colonial style hotels,and over the years have stayed in quite a few. Unfortunately the GRH isn't one of the best. It has its good points- all of the staff were good and the food we ate was particularly good- especially the evening buffet which was one of the best we ate in Sri Lanka- the view from the restaurant overlooking the harbour was impressive.. Our room was OK, the double bed was a bit small and the bathroom needed a lot of work. The room was incredibly noisy- there is constant noise from the docks, not helped by the windows having big gaps around them- luckily we had ear plugs with us.  The area around the hotel is pretty seedy,so luckily the food was great and we had no reason to go out. Tuk tuk from the Fort station is only RS200.",Date of stay: October 2017
AndrewFernando,Grand Buffet Dinner to live music,"While we were in Colombo on a short holiday in September, we had dinner at Grand Oriental Hotel with our friends. This hotel has a long history of more than 125 years. The building has been refurbished but has retained itês colonial look reminding the period of English rule. We have visited this place long ago in 1980s for a wedding function. It is still the same and its reputation has grown with time. The restaurant is on the fourth floor and we booked a table for our small group. It is one of the best buffet dinners we had in Colombo, reasonably priced and of good quality.

There is a certain charm no doubt, although the hotel has definitely seen better days. But it is a well-known property and our taxi driver immediately knew where to take us. It is also very close to the Fort train stationãyou can walk there if you need to, and that's very convenient if you have a train to catch (which we did). The staff were extremely helpful, and my interaction with them was very smooth and satisfactory. The hotel has a beautiful bar/restaurant at the top with marvellous views of the harbour. I highly recommend getting a late-night drink here! However, overall, it's not good value for money. I'd have expected to pay less for my experience.",Date of stay: September 2017

Initially, I thought I made the wrong decision to book here because I did not find this place impressionable at all.  But after 2-3 nights, I then began to appreciate the rustic atmosphere of this property. From the bed to the floor to the tiles and pieces of furniture, I could say that they maintained the rustic atmosphere to stand with the rest of the luxury hotels in the city.  Yet I think they could still improve. They really need to improve the lighting in all floors and rooms. I also think they can improve the safety and security of the place.  They need to provide a safe box in all rooms! I did not have one during my visit. And this caused much concern every time I would leave the room.

Breakfast was good and plentiful.  Once again, the staff were excellent, sorted out a take out breakfast as we left early, and carried bags etc and helped sort out the problems we encountered.

On my second stay, though, the rate was much higher, I was made to register for a second time - which is just inefficient after a long day of travelling - and I noticed just how dirty the tiled floor of the room was.

There was no hotel safe (an absolute must-have for travellers!), and the water pressure in the shower was hopeless.

Plenty of transport options around (if you like tuk-tuks), and close to train and bus stations and the Pettah / markets. A taxi from the airport cost about 3,000 rupiah (approx $30 AUS). The restaurant was a little disappointing - breakfast curries were dry and over-cooked, and the one morning I had the chicken sausages was the last.

Tienshan,"Large, rambling, slightly faded hotel well worth a visit.","We booked a night at the GOH at the end of our two weeks back packing in Sri Lanka to taste  a bit of style and history before leaving this sunny land. .They didn't reply to 2 or 3 emails requesting a quiet room so we weren't unduly surprised to be shown into one on the 3rd floor rather too close to a busy road. I asked Reception for a room change but was flatly refused- not a good start . However, to be fair the room was clean, cool and spacious with the very high ceiling favoured by Victorian Brits, and everything in it and in the bathroom worked fine. (except that my partner's I-pad couldn't pick up the wifi consistently.)  The immediate vicinity of the hotel isn't exactly salubrious- we walked past a guy feeding rice to some large rodents in the street about 250 mtrs.away-",Date of stay: November 2016
Edward W,"Historic architecture with by gone charm; amazing, classy buffet lunch","Not sure why so many people have given The Grand Oriental such bad ratings.  It's fantastically quaint, full of history and beautifully designed.  It's certainly not modern and if that's what you're looking for then this isn't the hotel for you, but the rooms are large, clean and extremely quiet.  Not to mention the buffet lunch for 1500 rupees was one of the best meals we've had in Sri Lanka, while the view of the shipping yard was really incredible. Additionally, the service was prompt and done with a smile.  What else could you ask for for the price? As a final point, I read a comment below that mentioned how this hotel reminded the reviewer of a Wes Anderson movie, with quirky charm around every corner.  I couldn't agree more.",Date of stay: November 2016

The room was a bit tired and not a true reflection of the website photos.  However, the buffet restaurant on the top floor is well worth a night time visit, even if you don't stay there - great views of the port.

Robert K,Faded seaside glory,"Hotel was introduced to us by a travel agent as not quite up to par, but in a nice neighborhood. Historical building, that has seen better days, no doubt. Location indeed is fine, near the Dutch hospital area with some fine restaurants. We stayed here twice, the first time in a spacious room with a canopy bed. Second visit we had a small standard room, including a large skylight, making sure that the room is illuminated all night long, even when you would like to go to sleep. Bathrooms are very small and should be the first priority for an upgrade. Main asset is the restaurant on the top floor including a nice view of the harbor. Breakfast is ok. Main annoyance is the staff at reception. One would expect that when you return to a hotel a couple of weeks after your first visit",Date of stay: October 2016

It is full of strange nooks and oddly (but charmingly) decorated rooms and feels like a slice of history. Plus, the breakfast room at the top overlooking the harbor is legit fabulous.

The hotel is centrally located, but in a run down block next to the port, which also describes the hotel.

Definitely not worth 10,400 rupee! Also, be careful when ordering a taxi to take you to the airport, from the front desk. Make sure to get them to write down the agreed price.

Hollie A,Old and scary,This made me feel like I was on the set of a scary movie. Classical music played in the halls until late and rattling trolleys could be heard constantly up and down the halls all night. The view from my window was a falling down building with air conditioners that had fallen off lying on the ground below. I later learned that this was actually the same building. Staff were lovely and very helpful. Bar has a good view of the harbours if you're into ships. Apparently Queen Elizabeth used to stay there. That must've been a hundred years ago and it hasn't been done up since then. Staff were the only positive for me.,Date of stay: July 2016

dcawkwell,Lovely old hotel,I stayed at this hotel in June 2016 for 2 nights. This cost £44 pounds a night for the room plus local Colombo taxes that are quite high about 30%. Some of the reviews are variable but I enjoyed my stay very much. We stayed in off season so the place was virtually empty. In the evening we got tables in the restaurant right at the window with excellent views over the port. I have stayed at 3 star hotels in different parts of the world and in the UK. The service from  the staff left any UK hotel standing they were very attentive. Evening meals where acceptable up to Sri Lanka standards. perhaps not up to European standards. It seems fries with every meal that isn't curry is standard and few vegetables. Breakfast was fine if a little aimed towards Sri Lanka tastes. No pork,Date of stay: June 2016

Our room was huge with a wonderful polished wooden floor like a ballroom. The beds with their splendid wooden headboards were huge and very comfortable. The wood of which there is a lot is very dark and can give the room a heavy, gloomy feel but this feeling fades away as you start to truly appreciate the spaciousness and comfort.

There is nothing modern about the amenities in the rooms except a tv and an air conditioning unit.  The rest of the building is not air conditioned so it is muggy in the halls and smells of smoke.

While a major renovation might be a little out of the question, the very least they could do is buy new towels and sheets or invest in WiFi that's actually usable.   This hotel is not worth the money as there are MUCH better value hotels all over the city. Avoid this place until they renovate or lower the price.",Date of stay: December 2015

While trying to order a drink for a foreign guest at the function I encountered the terrible arrogant attitude of the banquets manager who was determined to humiliate a guest to prove a point. While whole handling of the situation was over bearing, rude and completely inappropriate.

TheSage S,Has character but overpriced,"The Grand Oriental is situated around a 10 minute walk from Colombo Fort train station and is an old fashioned colonial style hotel with chandeliers, Victorian furniture, a grand piano etc. It definitely has character and the room itself had good facilities, but I would have expected more luxury for £55 a night, which is very high by Sri Lankan standards.  They also charged 650 rupees (about £3) for a bottle of beer which is more the kind of price I would expect to pay in London! I also found the staff a little rude and haughty at times.

The polished brass name plates, old fashioned uniforms, piano player, 4 poster beds etc are all contributing to the look and feel of what the GOH used to be like.   The dinner buffet was great value and really tasty 1k SLR which was good, live entertainment singing the songs of times gone by adds to the experience.   Not really any negatives, the hotel is a bit tired (to be expected I guess) the location is not ideal either as its in the port and not really close to anything.

Upon arrival, the manager would not honor the rate that was posted online, and continued to berate us and make us feel unwelcome. The language and attitude he had towards us, as paying customers, was condescending and rude.   On top of everything else, what is described online as ""grand,"" ""nostalgic"" colonial architecture, is actually run-down, crumbling, and smelly. There weren't basic amenities in the hotel room, like TOILET PAPER, shampoo/conditioner, a hair dryer, etc. It took us several calls to the service desk to actually get toilet paper in our room.

Everyone is confused about everything and everything needs ages to be solved.   As we are traveling across 8 countries we are staying in many hotels around the globe. But GOH will remain in our memory unfortunately not because it's history, location, etc., but because of confusion mainly.

Laura S,Update required,"The hotel has a quite good location, at a walking distance to the beach and to the raÍl way station and the bus stop to the airport, and there are also some shops close by. However, it is clear they need a little bit of investment. The service was not the best and the room was not very clean.  The room was very big but the view to the backyard showed that some painting in the beautiful colonial faades is required.  They offered us some juice when we arrived, and that was very nice, but then there were like eight guys in the reception and it took them a while to give us the key to our room.  We paid 68$ and I think that, in Sri Lanka, for the quality of the services, the price was very high.",Date of stay: January 2015

Bobbicz,History,"If you're interested in reliving a piece of history you'll like GOH as the view of the port from the restaurant hasn't changed since the building was constructed in 1837.  The rooms and furnishings haven't changed since probably 1930 but are fortunately air conditioned.  The staff is extremely pleasant and the reception staff speak excellent English  Be sure to book your transfer from the airport to the hotel when you book. It will cost you 50 but taxi fare is even more.  I don't recommend the hotel spa. It's terribly ordinary and not conducive to relaxation.

JustOnTheWay,Good value for money - urgently needs refurbishment,"My first thought entering the hotel was: ""Where did I end up here?"". Both, building and service were quite dusty. After quite a walk I came to my room with its scratched furniture which seemed to have been repaired by amateurs. Only the short film about the hotel which you can watch on TV channel 1 reminded of the better days of this hotel... I heard that the hotel might be refurbished soon. I guess that's a great plan!  The reason why I still rate the hotel with 3 stars is the good restaurant in 4th floor with an incredible view over the harbour. Considering the age of the hotel you can imagine the landing sailing ships. Btw. breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets are recommendable. All in all prices in the hotel are reasonable.

The room was big and the single bed with the canopy was also big.  There was AC which worked though a bit on the noisy side.  There was TV with a few useful English channels such as BBC and Al Jazeera.  ( In the 2 days that I was there, the most that these English channels talked about seemed to be the death of Australian cricket player Philip Hughes. )  It's nice that they provided you 2 bottles of water every day (free of charge).

Rudi M,Very Dated but Charming,"Not so easy to write a balanced review. I enjoyed my stay at the GOH, as I was very interested to learn more about the history of this grand old dame. There is certainly plenty of history here and most of it is on display. With the old business district in the Fort area finally seeing a revival, it is indeed interesting to walk around the neighborhood here and take in one more time how the Asian city of the past looked like and functioned. There are not too many left, as development and commercial interests take first priority and the old and established is often either demolished and replaced or over-renovated. The GOH sets you back in time for a short period and makes one wonder how the passengers on one of the steamers arriving here would be longing for the GOH's hospitality",Date of stay: November 2014

The waiters wear sailor outfits.  They have free wifi. Beautiful view of the Harbour. Outdoor patio. I'm speaking specifically of the 4th floor dining room. It has a piano player who is very good as well. This is a wonderful place to decompress.  The food is good and the view of the harbor is awesome. It's a bastion of civility and calmness in crazy colombo. You must go if you are looking for good safe food at a reasonable price in a lovely atmosphere.

Being my first time to Sri Lanka, I was eager to stay in a property reminiscent of a bygone era. My wife and I live in very modern home, so a chance to stay in something a little dated but with some old world charm initially appealed to us.   I'd found out that the Grand Oriental had once been a Dutch barracks dating back hundreds of years. Apparently Queen Elizabeth herself had even stayed there once.  But the truth is that this place is not as charming and lovely as they would have you believe. The sheen has certainly dissipated from this onetime, ""gem of the orient.""

Although there are numerous extravagant/expensive establishments in Colombo, the GOH indeed has the best locality of them all. The view of the Colombo Harbour from the Harbour room is simply breathtaking. I remember the last time I was there at the Harbour room with my family sometime back, we were taken on a musical trip down memory lane by Sam the Man. This hall also brings many sentimental memories to my family as both my parents & grandparents had both had their wedding receptions many years ago. Sam the Man had provided music for my parents' wedding.  It is unfair to compare the GOH to other more modern recently built, overpriced hotels in Colombo.

Once I entered the room it was dull and cold. The interior must be from when the hotel was built 200 years ago. The bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom was dirty. The worst however about having a harbor view is the fact that you can hear the loud noises of the harbor all night long. Believe it or not, but those rooms are the most expensive in the hotel.",Date of stay: October 2013
Padmanaban M,Heritage nee ancient hotel,It is centrally located and the reception lounge is spacious and charming old world style. But the rooms/corridors are also maintained ancient way i.e no maintenance. The Bed is Victorian and one has to climb on to it.... TV and aircon are also matchingly one generation old. But the restaurant offers a fabulous view of the harbor and good food also.Would not suggest this hotel to anyone unless one gets a great deal.,Date of stay: October 2013
Dani53,Love this hotel!,"my second stay here . I admit I am a fan of old colonial ladies such as the GOH and the Queens in Kandy. For me she is value for money, history, location close to Main Street, the Harbour View restaurant is special, and even the local bar/nightclub downstairs can be 'interesting' to say the least. Staff on both my visits have been courteous and efficient. GOH is located in an exciting part of town - the old dutch hospital precinct is starting to 'happen' and Sri Lankans are understanding that not all tourists want to visit gleaming shopping malls. GOH is an easy walk to the Colombo Hilton, The Galle Face hotel, The Kingbury etc and that is fine - I ate my lunch at the Harbour Room, Sunset drinks at the Galle face , My Dinner in the Dutch Hospital precinct and my Breakfast at the",Date of stay: September 2013

thelmatt,Terrible Experience,"We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights and would have definitely made a change had we not paid the tour operator in advance. The rooms were dirty and seedy while the corridors were tunnels where guests were allowed to smoke as there were no balconies in any of the rooms. The bed was very normal and we had to request for extra pillows as only two were left for triple occupancy. The bathrooms were the worst. The plumbing was terribly leaky with cockroaches. There was no hot water and when we complained about the leaking toilet drain and the lack of hot water, the staff took over an hour to respond. They then came over and said we won't get hot water as the water heater was solar powered.

We settled for another which had a GOH signature king size lace-draped four poster bed, a three piece lounge suite, dressing table, full length mirror and overlooked the historic Port Authority Building and harbor.

Positive points about the hotel:  1.	The location of the hotel is suitable for business purposes as the hotel is just at a walking distance from the Petta Market and shopping.

The air conditioning in my room did not work, the shower recess flooded the bathroom and when I put my laundry out it did not all come back.  The hotel staff did not try to locate the laundry items and sent three men to my room to obtain a description of the lost underwear.  The hotel was not clean and there were small piles of dirt in various locations.  The food was very ordinary.  The hotel was large and the lifts way too small.  In an emergency such as a fire it would be bedlam.  Fortunately I was able to find alternate  accommodation for the remainder of my stay in Columbo.  Would not recommend this hotel to anyone - if you must stay there - do your own laundry and take gum boots for when you shower!",Date of stay: July 2012
Fahri B,only for nostalgia lovers,"GOH is probably the oldest hotel in Colombo. If you love nostalgia, it`s the right place to stay. Even Chehov stayed in that place. But..GOH needs definitely refurbishment!!! Especially bad rooms. I stayed 3times in GOH and always were the same case with bad rooms : quite old and not 100% clean.  Since the hotel was used to be a barrack for the British army most of the rooms are quite big. Generally it is quite loud in the hotel. Staff is not so professional. The single room price( 96 USD incl. breakfast) is a little bit to high for this hotel. But I guesssince all the other hotels in Colombo are much more expensive, the GOH Management dont see any need to change it. Harbour Room, where you can have breakfast, lunch, dinner is the best part of the hotel. Very nice view to",Date of stay: July 2012
alphonseraj77,BITTER EXPERIENCE,"On a recent vacation trip to Sri Lanka, my tour agent had made bookings for my group of 8 at the Grand Oriental Hotel, Upon arrival at about 9.30pm, we were met by a bellhop who refused to help carry our luggage. The staff at the reception were so rude and unfriendly. Though we were booked into the new wing, the staff refused to provide us rooms there. Instead we were shown rooms at the old wing which had heavy cigarette and liquor stench, old furniture, a noisy air-conditioner and the list can go on. No progress even after our tour agent had spoken with the Manager. When we turned down the old wing rooms, the Manager told us curtly that we could leave. Fortunately, our tour agent made alternative arrangements at The Hilton where we had a wonderful stay. I strongly advise anyone",Date of stay: June 2012
TraveLover097,Fantastic Hotel!,A old hotel in Colombo but great! Fantastic Rooms! Great staff. Having stayed in the Deluxe room we enjoyed our stay in the Grand Oriental Hotel! The only disadvantage was that there was no channel to watch Euro 2012 and you'd have to go to watch in Hilton! other than that everything else was very nice! I really recommend this hotel!,Date of stay: June 2012
Manish Kamdar,Only one word - AVOID,"A dump is what I would call it. Spent one night and then ran away to Ramada in Colombo. I landed by the early morning flight from Mumbai and reached the hotel at 6 am. They gave me a room saying use this room till 10 am as all rooms are full. The room was terrible. A small bed, shower churning out water drop by drop... Everything that could go wrong was wrong here. And to think it was USD 96 for a night. Whatever other reviewers may have said, I would say just don't go there. Avoid like plague.",Date of stay: June 2012

We had breakfast the next day and it was really really nice, with fresh fruits and coffee...

Jacki_PerthWA,Tired old hotel,"We booked this hotel for our last night in Sri Lanka and thank goodness it was only for one night. The room was old, en-suite the size of a cupboard and no hot water! We decided on the Sri Lankan buffet dinner - turned out to be Mongolian ""Oh, that advertisement shouldn't have been in your room!"" so we went down to the little restaurant in the lobby and had a pretty good Sri Lankan meal for two, with drinks for about $10 Australian. Sleep was almost impossible due to the noise from outside and then oncve that had stopped, someone in the restaurant above our room decided it would be a good idea to start hammering and drilling at 2am. We left at 4am for an early flight and the receptionist basically couldn't give two hoots when we asked what all the noise was about, just shrugged",Date of stay: April 2012

Jubbsi,A Grand old place past it's sell by date,"On arrival this hotel looks to be a lovely old place however when you delve a bit deeper it appears nothing has been done to maintain the hotel since its glory days.  We stayed at a range of accommodations in Sri Lanka from 5 star luxury to backpacker style.  This place was by far the most expensive and worst.  After several emails back and forward I eventually managed to secure a room at quite a high price, as it was only for one night and the right side of the city for the airport I accepted the price.  However, the price quoted was far different to what you actually pay once they have added on a myriad of taxes and service charges.  This applies to everything in the hotel as well, so please be careful when assessing the value of something.   The rooms are large and basic but",Date of stay: March 2012
Chris M,Can't quite make my mind up,"As the 3/5 rating and title suggests, I can't quite make my mind up about this hotel. We travelled here on the last night of our holiday in Sri Lanka as a place to see Colombo and in my case see the last day of the cricket between England and Sri Lanka. The check in was a bit of a farce. We had booked the room through an independent booking site and somehow the booking had got mixed up. Even though we had evidence by email, it did seem like the staff didn't believe us and were determined to prove us wrong. After waiting about an hour, eventually the manager came in to say he had found his booking and offered us a room in the hotel. I found him to be quite rude but in fairness during the rest of our stay, he was polite when I bumped into him in the lobby etc. The hotel was huge",Date of stay: April 2012
NewYork-Bryan,Old World Charm - Too Old,"This could be a charming hotel if restored. But now, the lobby is the only good thing about it. Room was large but not decorated or furnished well, walls were vacant. Bathroom featured old, worn faucets, a shower head installed so the water hits the wall only - not your body - and there were no hooks for clothes or even a shelf to put toothpase. I was sent here by a tour agency and wouldn't stay here again. If you're not picky and like old world things, really old, then this is the place for you.

Jon M,Top Range Hotel? I dont think so!,"I was looking forward to staying here after 5 days in guesthouses. It was going to be a little luxury at the end of my trip. Who would have thought I would crave to be back in a guesthouse soon after arriving?   The check in was unprofessional. It was as if I wasnêt expected despite having emailed only days before. I showed the email on my iphone, but I had to go into the staff area and log on and print it off. Very odd.   The main issue I have is the quality of the room. It was in extreme disrepair. The bed was very hard. The air conditioning was old and very noisy and makes sleep impossible. The TV remote was held together with sticky tape and cardboard.

Ritchy41,Oriental perhaps but definitely not Grand!!!,"Luckily we spend only one night at this hotel. Check in was smooth and efficient and helpfull staff brought us to the room on the 3rd floor facing the busy harbor. The room was spacious but the bed was very hard and no hot water in the shower. All looked a bit dated. Noise from the corridors as well as from outside reach your room. When telling the reception about loud music and screaming in the corridors they just answered ""yes but it is a group!"" so if you are group you are entitled to ruin the other guests sleep??? Not very professional. The area itself is not very attractive and pretty boring at night. As this hotel is listed as the Grand Dame of Colombo it is time to reinvest.

We paid extra for what we thought would be a good hotel, used to dealing with international arrivals in the early hours. How wrong we were! We had informed them in an email via agoda (the booking site) of our arrival time and my husband even phoned the hotel direct and was told that this was not a problem. However when we arrived it was obvious there was a problem and it transpired that our room had been given to someone else.

gmat30,Nothing more than the ordinary!,Pretty much your average business hotel to say the least. One glance and you may feel its a bit shady and dodgy at that. The front office staff were not among the best for sure. The rooms were very average. Room service was ordinary. The bathrooms were decent. And dont expect to watch your favourite shows in this hotel since the TV was barely viewable not to mention the fact there were barely any channels to view from. Breakfast was excellent at the Harbour view and the dining experience was up to the mark although I cant seem to remember the name of the restaurant. Overall it was ok but I will definitely look out for other options next time!,Date of stay: December 2011

Waiters a bit annoying, they came over every few minutes to pour drinks, remove dishes etc.  Interesting view, but not exactly scenic, + live mood music.  Room Best described as variable.   On our first stay we were given quite dark, dingy rooms, with bathrooms that had seen better days.  There was a fridge in each room, but it was unstocked.

Trinz,Very Stuffy,"the hotel is located in a very high security area, but offers a wonderful view of the harbour, the rooms were very stuffy, musty and smelt of cigarett smoke, the staff was extremely rude, and did not bother to come and replace the TV remote inspite of calling them more than 5 times. the food also had very few options and was totally forgettable. overall not a very pleasant experience",Date of stay: December 2008
kanivannan,Good location,"Good Location, Good food, Nice staffs, Nice view of the harbour....    C.Kanivannan Chennai India   (--)",Date of stay: November 2009
lavatea,Misled by the name and history,"The entrance and reception are good, The rooms are untidy, the food is good, especially the buffet served at night.   The bar has a good view of the port. There is no pool, The club attached to the Grand Oriental is also not so Grand, just a cheap pick-up joint.   THe larger problem is there is  nothing in the vicinity of the hotel after evening hours. Being the old port area and now a commercial hub, this area is deserted after evening.  The hotel displays a old brass memorial depicting when and how this hotek was built. I must however admit that this feeling of staying in a historic hotel kept me going for 2 days. Not even worth the $ 100 odd that they charge per room.",Date of stay: September 2006
A Tripadvisor Member,Good location but old room facility!,"Location is close to the train station and beach. A good variety of buffet breakfast both for western and SriLanka styles. This historical hotel has nostalgic atmosphere. You can put your valuable belongs in the safety box in lobby for free. The double room we stayed was spacious, but the decoration/facility was old. The room was a bit dark in the evening. I heard that some rooms were renovated, but not the one we stayed. If you want to experience the historical hotel, this could be a good choice. I will try other hotels next time.",Date of stay: November 2009
A Tripadvisor Member,Beautiful outside/Inside needs work,"Sadly, I did enjoy Colombo at all. It is under heavy security so I would recommend going south to one of the small beach towns to truly appreciate the incredible beauty that Sri Lanka has to offer from the people to the amazing water and food. However The Grand Oriental needs serious work. Also the club below that is associated with the hotel is seedy and really should either be shut down or changed into something more appropriate. It is traditional Indian dancers, but they look miserable and you can tell that the scene is more than just a place to drink. I would recommend staying at the Cinnamon Grand, The Hilton, or a different Hotel.   The most irritating thing is that the hotel constantly tried to cheat us out of money by arranging tours without our permission. I would go",Date of stay: September 2009
A Tripadvisor Member,"Grand Oriental Hotel, Colombo","The Grand Oriental definitely recalls the days of the Raj, with its beautifully appointed marble floored reception area and grand staircase. The staff are deferential and discreet but still friendly. The coffee shop is excellent value - the club sandwich with chips at around 1.50GBP being excellent value for money. Airport transfers at around 15GBP (per taxi) from the in-house travel agent also reasonably priced and reliable for our 5am pick up.",Date of stay: August 2009
A Tripadvisor Member,great,"Hotel Grand Oriental is a heritage building.I was in this hotel in 2001,2008 and 2009.I like this hotel because of its location.The behaviour of the hotel staff is great.The ambience is also nice.I will come again for my business on june2009 and will stay at this hotel.Breakfast is also great with lot of variety.",Date of stay: May 2009
sendilse,The colonial building,"The first thing that struck me about this hotel is its colonial architecture. Its a part of history. The hotel is overseeing the port and provides good view of the sea. The tariff is very cheap for the facilities. There is no swimming pool though. If you don't believe spending too much on hotels but want a nice place to stay with no frills, then Grand oriental is the place. As soon as you enter the hotel for check-in, you are greeted warmly and while you are filling up the form, you are served with a refreshing welcome drink. I was very impressed and thank ful for the same since it was very hot outside and after a long drive from the airport, it feels good to gulp something cold !... The hotel is located in a nice place and there is a tap bar which can be a nice place to hang",Date of stay: March 2006
Sharat K,avoidable,"It's not good at all...the rooms and the hotel stink badly.  Especially the old wing.  If they are giving you the old wing, please don't fall for the charm of it, it is sick and horrible.  the only good part is the spa and the food...",Date of stay: August 2008
Nathan227,Decent value for money with sufficient hotel restaurant,Room was spacious with quiet air con and cold fridge. Bathroom had bathtub with hot water which is a rare find in SL. Staff were friendly. Location is good for those wanting to do some sight seeing around Colombo and great for those catching the train to other parts of the country (central train station only a few blocks away). Business centre pricing is excessively expensive and the attach nightclub is a depressing venue to walk into.,Date of stay: February 2009
A Tripadvisor Member,Good value for money,Grand Oriental is good value for money. Rooms are spacious and clean. Sanitary has been recently replaced and is working!Staff is  very friendly. The hotel is located in the high safety area with high number of security checkpoints.The area is therefore very desolated which makes you feel like staying in ghost town.,Date of stay: January 2009
aroonanand,Nothing Grand or Oriental about it,"I was also one of the travellers to be fooled by the description of the hotel in the website and snaps..The reception and lobby was the only decent part of the hotel. Old room with furniture probably 50 years old, noisy AC...Staff were ok but incapable lot at the reception. Tried to overcharge me for the 10% charge I paid online as well as by breaking the cost into several items to confuse me, and internet which did not work. Food ordered in room service was quite nice. No facility to make phone calls from room, which was just simply ridiculous...Had to use this hotel at the last minute as Ceylon Continental bungled with my booking and did not get a room which was pre-booked and paid 10 days in advance !!!   Advice to travellers - stay away from the Grand Oriental. Might have",Date of stay: October 2008
VincentOne,Never stay at this place !,"Don't be fooled by this hotel's name - undoubtedly it was a ""Grand Oriental Hotel"" - but that was 100 years ago. The lobby is probably the nicest part of the hotel, it's all steep downhill from there. The hotel overall is really dilapidated. We stayed one night, actually checked out at 3am to catch an onward flight and were glad to leave the hotel. It was truely one of the worst if not THE worst hotel I've ever stayed in the past 20 years.  The hotel corridors were dark and gloomy, we didn't see any other tourists/travelers in lobby, restaurant or elsewhere.  After phoning the hotel's general manager, we were upgraded to a bigger room, because our first room had a noisy rattling A/C. The room had dark brown coarse terracotta tiles, probably from the sixties. The room's walls,",Date of stay: September 2008
shakyscorpion,Never stay if its free as well,"The room ambiance was good, without a bath, and hot water and a/c were unreliable Things went well until the last day when we had to leave for the airport early morning. We had settled the bill previous day and when we were about to leave they came back saying we didnêt pay the Mini Bar Bill. There was a heated argument and the Hotel manager behaved indecently and he was about to hit us and we had to open our luggage and show him the bill after which he said Sorry typical sri-lankan. We had to rush up to Airport with Little children and had really hurry up due to this.  This made us almost miss our flight. We placed several complaints through many channels. The bedroom, even it was large, had a bedspread that was stained and filthy looking, and both the curtains around the bed",Date of stay: August 2008
DeadSeaFisherman,"good food, bad room","it is a good value hotel, rooms r not so good, some rooms r terrible!!, food could be the best in Colombo and nice view of harbour at harbour view restaurant, service is ok, I do not recommend it for business people.",Date of stay: May 2003
furhan,so much potential going to waste,"* Beautiful building * Fine interiors * Weird hot water system * Friendly, polite, courteous staff, like most people in Colombo * Harbour restaurant has a very fine view and the breakfast is just great  Things went well until the last day when we had to leave for the airport in afternoon. Came back after some last minute shopping only to discover that the lock in our room had been removed and there were 5 people inside doing God knows what - They said, it was the room service. We had explicitly told the staff at the desk that we would ASK for a room service when we need one. The beds were made but did we ask them for that? and what kind of room service removes the door knobs to enter. To make matters worse, they asked us to pay for a bottle of water that we used from their",Date of stay: March 2007
TravelBugHet,Breakfast like a King!,"We arrived in Sri Lanka after a month backpacking round Japan on a budget. After a month in youth hostels, any hotel was going to be good, but the Grand Oriental was something else!! Porters opened the doors for us and ushered us into the grand lobby, the staff were lovely, everything was beautiful. Our room was big and airy, high cielings, comfortable beds. The hotel is wonderfully located in the heart of Colombo, in a great area to just wander around, very close to markets. The breakfast was absolutely fabulous - a buffet affair with so much to choose from! There was English type cooked breakfast (sausages, bacon etc) as well as Sri Lankan curries, chapatis etc. Cold buffet of meats and cheeses, fruit platters, various breads and pastries, and of course plenty of Ceylon tea.",Date of stay: September 2006
FULL-SPEED-AHEAD,A fading lady,"What was once a Grand hotel is now a faded lady. Excellent service and food and the hotel has a top floor restaurant giving a wonderful overview of the harbour and ships coming and going. The ground floor Sri Lankan restaurant served a near  lukewarm buffet on the night we ate there. The bedroom, whilst large, had a bedspread that was stained and grubby looking, and both the curtains around the bed and at the windows looked as though they hadn't been cleaned in years. Rather bizarrely, the bottom bed sheet didn't cover all the mattress so you had to rest on the bare mattress. The ensuite bathroom looked as though it was last updated in the 60's. With the advent of air travel and demise of passenger ships, the hotel is now out on a limb and right next to the high security zone.",Date of stay: November 2006
MikeWReading,Cheaper than others but you get what you pay for!,"Stayed here for 10 days in March/April 2006.  Booking through a travel agent got the rate down to $45 per night, but the room was very small, without a bath, and hot water and a/c were erratic.  The views from the harbour restaurant are good (and the sailors uniforms for the staff are amusing) but you're not supposed to take photos as the port is a high security area.  Roads are cordoned off at night (10 p.m to 5 a.m, when the barriers are removed which can be very noisy!), so it's a bit like being in a war zone.  The staff are generally quite friendly, and it could be a really great hotel, but sadly it isn't.",Date of stay: April 2006
Daisy005,Lovely locally-owned hotel,"We stayed with a party of friends at the Grand Oriental which is locally-owned, situated overlooking the harbour, near to the city centre.  Great views from the restaurant over the city and the busy docks. Food was international and uninspiring. All the waiting staff wore what seemed to be Navy uniforms.  Views were not so great from many of the rooms, but ours had a four-poster bed with drapes like gypsy caravan.  Finding a bar to have a few relaxing drinks proved elusive.  There were only high bar stools and no comfortable chairs.",Date of stay: February 2006
