griechenklaus	Nearly everything perfect	"Everything was perfect in this hotel: quality of the room, of food and drinks. Great hospitality, very friendly nd professional stuff. We stayed in room 2044, which had a large balcony facing the sea. There was only on problem: The music from the carribean beach bar, which stopped only after midnight. This and near-by rooms should have real sound-proof windows! Nevertheless we would stay in this room again because of its great balcony!"	Date of stay: March 2020

Grace R	A pleasant hotel	"We stayed one night before catching our flight home.   Pros:  Beautiful building - very grand and well presented throughout.  Lovely staff.  Fantastic breakfast buffet! One of the best we experienced in our 2 week trip.  Good location by the ocean.   Cons:  Stuffy room with a musty smell.  Poor water pressure in the shower.  Horrible pillows - too soft and rather lumpy.  Light came under the door - coupled with the bad pillows, this resulted in a poor night’s sleep."	Date of stay: March 2020
Mozzie	Stunning Colonial Hotel	"We stayed two nights and wish we had longer. All staff in all areas were amazingly helpful and smiling, I couldn’t have asked for better service. Room was clean and large with a very big balcony, also enjoyed the complementary bar fridge. I stayed in a premium room with balcony which I highly recommend not only for the room but also for the complementary long room happy hour. Very good value for money. Thank you for a beautiful stay."

Savi R	Beautiful Galle Face Hotel	"It was a splendid experience.   I stayed in the hotel for two nights (too short), and from the arrival to departure, every staff member I had to deal with was nothing but helpful.  Very rare customer service experience.   Lovely breakfast, restaurants.  In short loved everything."	Date of stay: March 2020
Kate R	Grandeur of days long ago.	Our one night stay at the Galle Face Hotel was the final night of a wonderful tour of Sri Lanka. The Hotel is wonderfully located overlooking the harbour and we had a brilliant sunset the night we were there. The eating and drinking areas are the best part of the hotel as they overlook the water. The reception when we arrived wasn't up to the standard we had come to expect in the other hotels we stayed at. Not enough care was taken and not enough explanation of the room and the hotel's facilities. We needed a technician to fix the air conditioning and the room had a smell of damp. The hotel is very grand but it IS old.	Date of stay: March 2020
Niki S	Magical wedding venue	"We planned my brother's wedding here last month because this is where our grandparents were married in 1951. It went off without a hitch. Cocktails on the chequer board at sunset, and the ballroom lit up with fairy lights was beyond magical. The food surpassed all expectations! Service and staff went above and beyond for all of us. Amila was our point of contact at the hotel and he made sure my brother and his wife got everything they wanted for their special day. It was truly a pleasure working with Galle Face Hotel."

Vmn	Warm hospitality	"Next day to the full moon Poya day, I was able to step in to the most historical and iconic hotel in Sri Lanka. It was a busy day, and I was there for a business purpose. Ms. Ivoni, saw me that I was seated for a while, she walked towards me and asked whether she could offer something! I didn't want to refuse, then she served me a lime juice with milk toffee. Sour with sweet, best combo ever had. It was my pleasure being there, without any hesitation I would recommend this hotel for all the travellers around the world!!"	Date of stay: March 2020

Fabienne	excellent	"Galle Face hotel is superb, facing the ocean.  The staff is excellent, very kind and helpful.  One of the receptionist helped me to arrange my sari that I’ve waered  for a wedding and I was not use to wear one, thank you again.  Keeth, our room attendant, is excellent, helpful and very king person, thanks also to him !  We will definitely come back"	Date of stay: March 2020

anilpras	Good team work for events	"Our college (Sri Lanka College of Microbiologists) for the first time booked Grand Ballroom  of GFH for our induction of the President and oration. This event was smoothly carried out with preplanning with Nimanthika. We got a nice area for photographs of the council, good table decor and excellent service. Our morning tea had savoury and sweet items fresh fruits, fruit juice, tea and coffee. Even the vegetarians had a good choice. Lunch was buffet with good spread and a dessert table to satisfy sweet lovers.  quick replenishment of the items with helpful service attached praise from the members. Car parking is also not a problem since there is ample parking in the premises."	Date of stay: February 2020
Michael M	Classic colonial style hotel in Sri Lanka	I have stayed in this hotel a few times and it is a memorable experience. The new wing at the back is better but more expensive. The old front wing is very stylish and quaint but a bit funky as has not been modernised.	Date of stay: September 2019
Chameekara R	Work Shop held	"We conducted a workshop at Galle Face today for government officials. The morning and afternoon tea was served with more than 6 snacks, fruit and juice. Lunch was served with both Sri Lankan and International cuisine. Venue was spacious and majestic.No other Colombo hotel had given a service like this. I can say it was excellent service and offerings from the hotel. Food and delivery of service was beyond expectations. Managers visited several times and checked the quality. Captain Nalin was remarkable."	Date of stay: March 2020

Mark C	Luxurious and iconic hotel	"We stayed a night at the Galle Face Hotel and absolutely enjoyed it. The hotel is simply stately, historical (one of the oldest hotels in Sri Lanka with a storied history) and luxurious. It even has it's own museum! And I would recommend guest to visit the museum.  Location: Right at the heart of Colombo next to Galle Face Green. It doesn't really get much more convenient than that.   Accommodation: We were given a generous upgrade to a Premier Ocean View room on the third floor. The room was large, clean and very comfortable. It had all the amenities you would expect from a luxury hotel. The view of the Indian Ocean was delightful. Drinks and snacks in the mini-bar were complimentary. The only complaint we had was that the lock for the toilet didn't work very well."	Date of stay: February 2020
Belinda S	Great stay	"We stayed for two nights at the beginning of a visit to Sri Lanka and two at the end. We enjoyed a junior suite, the first being in the older part. When we checked out we requested a suite with a sea view on our return - which we received. Both rooms were large, clean and with really comfortable beds. All staff were friendly and welcoming. The hotel has a lovely old fashioned charm and a great position close to the sea. We enjoyed the flag ceremony and as we had a suite this included afternoon tea/canapes along with cocktails. There were singers performing in the evening which was a nice touch. We ate in Mambo twice which was good and once again had live entertainment."	Date of stay: February 2020
ld2018497	What amazing staff!	"Wow! Where do I start!  We had our wedding reception at The Galleface Hotel at the end of January and it was absolutely amazing! Everything was perfect in every way, thanks to the fantastic team at The Galleface Hotel.  The location was simply stunning. The Galleface Hotel had organised a fantastic cocktail reception at the Checkerboard, followed by dinner and dancing at the Jubilee Ballroom. It was an absolute dream, and we couldn’t have asked for anything more.   The team at Galleface Hotel, especially Amila Perera and Wendell Rebeira are absolute stars, and we cannot re-iterate this enough.  They went out of their way to make us happy, and accommodated every single one of our requests with smiles on their faces. Nothing was too much trouble, and they were a real dream to work"	Date of stay: January 2020
vipindodhia	Overnight stopover	"Had an overnight stopover after we landed at Colombo before continuing our Sri Lanka trip. There was some miscommunication our request for special dietary requirements between the reception and kitchen so they did not prepare anything for us. But once we explained to the chef and the kitchen staff about our request, they went out of the way to prepare special food for us for both the evening meal and the breakfast. Well done to the kitchen staff."	Date of stay: February 2020

Goodltraveller	An extremely pleasant stay	We stayed here for two nights prior to joining a cruise ship and very much enjoyed the experience.  All the staff we met were extremely helpful from reception; concierge; the main restaurant and bar and made us feel very welcome. It seemed nothing was too much trouble and it was very much appreciated.  We used the extensive buffet  on the first night and ate a la carte on the second - both excellent.

Our registration & welcome to the Hotel was Handled by a young lady Receptionist  Ms Fazmeen. Who was courteous, well Spoken, & very poliet. We did see her through out our stay, & her customer Service skills were impeccable.  The Dinning room Staff was wonderful. I must Commend Mr. Karanangoda, for his attention to detail, with organizing our B'fast, for our trip to Kandy. The serving staff was very attentive during all meals. Also I need to commend the services of Jarnaka ( Laundry Staff ) , who always was very prompt, & very attentive to my moms & My requests, with our lundery Items.

Kumudesh	Great experience!	The hotel is really great and nice. Very supportive staff. Food was great. Worth every penny you spend. Had our wedding there. Got a suite to spend the night and really nice ambience. Hotel heritage is more than 100 years old. Appreciate how they are maintaining the grandeur of that place.	Date of stay: February 2020
Sou	Excellent experience	"I organised a conference trip for 12 people over 1 week. The logistics were arranged with the highest level of professionalism and efficiency. I was very happy with the service at the hotel, specifically with the service of Dhanuka Samaraweera, the Lobby Manager, who went above and beyond to accommodate us and to ensure that all of our needs were swiftly and efficiently met. What could have been a logistical nightmare was instead a very pleasant experience, with hardly any issues along the way. I will definitely revisit, and look forward to seeing Dhanuka and the rest of the team again soon."	Date of stay: February 2020
Alisdair M	"Comfort, grace and tradition - hard to beat in Colombo"	"I have visited the GFH twice and will return on future trips.   For long stays, I couldn't recommend a better place.  Rooms are very comfortable and well appointed,  ocean views are fantastic.  The restaurants are good if you want to stay in and the team is faultless - Chaya and Prasad deserve a special mention.

Donna B	Amazing experience	"We had one night here at the end of our trip. We arrived at 2pm and had late check out the next day. We didn't leave until 9 pm and we didn't leave the hotel the whole time. It was such a special experience. The staff are amazing especially Keeth who cleaned our room and looked after us. We had never experienced anything like this hotel before and it's such a great way to wind up our 2 week trip to a beautiful country. We were lucky enough to be there on a day that they do the hotel tour which was very interesting and great to see. There is nothing i would change about our stay, we even had an ocean view but it was a standard room so just very lucky. The traditions of the checkerboard Pimms bar at 5.30 with live music and the bagpipe flag lowering ceremony at 6.15pm were really"	Date of stay: February 2020

James Karl L	Stopover Colombo	The Galle Face Hotel is perfect for a 1-2 nights stay in Colombo. Very professionell service at the reception and in the restaurants. It's the most traditionell hotel of Sri Lanka and offers you the atmosphere to feel back in older times. The food is a mixture of local and international. From the hotel you also can start nice sightseeing trips. We will come back.	Date of stay: February 2020
leanne1812	Perfect location. Pretty character property.	If you're not looking to stay in a typical generic chain hotel but still like a good class & standard of room & facilities this hotel is perfect.  We stayed for two nights when we arrived in Sri Lanka.  Our room was upgraded and whilst it had no view and was a little dark it was very clean and had everything needed for a comfortable stay.  All the staff we encountered were friendly & helpful making sure we were enjoying our stay. Concierge were particularly helpful with our many queries.  My only criticism would be on arrival there was no one to help with our cases from the taxi. We struggled through the doors with large cases before assistance came. That wasn't a good first impression but thankfully was the only small negative.   We ate breakfast & dinner at the verandah and	Date of stay: February 2020

They managed to fulfill all our requirements even if they were last minute. The grand ballroom is ideal for an occasion like a symposium. It's big enough and tall enough so that it doesnt feel crowded and looks very spacious. Thanks Galle Face hotel.	Date of stay: February 2020
RaffaInLondon	Most appalling check-in service and staff	I don’t even know where to start. This is a 5 star hotel with substandard receptionists and check in manager. Most unfortunately the hotel took 45 minutes to find my booking claiming that I had made the wrong reservation. I had booked two rooms for two nights; and they only found one room under my son’s name. They told me to call my booking provider to sort it out or pay for the second room. Once I called the booking provider they confirmed I had pre-paid two rooms and asked to speak with the receptionist. The receptionist never apologised for the inconvenience and started getting confused with another guests booking that checked in before me. I asked to speak to the Manager and Im not sure the man I spoke to was actually the manager as he was not wearing a manager badge. I	Date of stay: February 2020

Chris G	Colonial hotel that has kept its routes	"This is a wonderful place to stay in Colombo, right by the sea with exclusive use of the seawater large swimming pool good food and rooms that are stylish, elegant and the two rooms we had over a couple of weeks had exceptional sea views, were peaceful and with large balconies with two sun loungers two chairs and a table. My only gripe was the slow service in both the poolside/outside bar and the terrace bar."	Date of stay: February 2020
hdias	Iconic Colonial Hotel in Colombo	"We spent 4 nights at the GFH which is an iconic hotel by the sea in Colombo. There are elements of yesteryear so this is not a fully up-to-date modern hotel. It is, however, a great experience if you wish to have a taste of Colonial life in Colombo. It has a lovely sea water swimming pool and a bagpiper plays while lowering the national flag at sundown every evening.  We were allocated a garden side room on the ground floor which was very peaceful thanks to the excellent receptionist who checked us in."	Date of stay: February 2020
Critica l	A historical link with the past now with a five star rating.	"Looking back thirty years or so my wife and I still have such fond memories of the old Galle Face Hotel, with occasional leaking roofs and basic bathrooms. However, this has all changed and one has to admit that this once stately and somewhat anachronistic; dare I say, colonial style hotel now competes well with the modern and forward looking Colombo. The rooms are elegant and the suites, many with sea views are magnificent. There’s probably no better place to stay and we’ve tried them all over the years. Certainly the best location.   Keeping pace with changing times we were fortunate enough to sample the food in a ‘pop up’ restaurant which was formally known as the 1864 fine dining room. I do hope that they make this a permanent feature.  Even better, arrange to dine privately"	Date of stay: February 2020

cosiwalkers	Iconic location with an understated tempo of its own	"A building that has featured so much in Colombo’s history but offering modern day comforts. Wonderfully relaxed breakfasts on the terrace, an ideal locations for daytime forays into Colombo and a tranquil place to escape to. The live Cuban band at the King of Mambo bar offers a lively alternative in the evenings and the cocktails are well worth a try."	Date of stay: February 2020

Wonderful room & very large terrace looking over the front lawn.  Service was very good, especially Jose, who looked after our room.  The 1st floor 1864 fine dining restaurant and spa were closed during our stay. The hotel recommended a nearby spa at Cinnamon Grand which was good.  The hotel arranged our airport transfer to the hotel which was very efficient.  The hotel offers complementary tours of the hotel twice a week by their historian - Tuesdays 10AM to 11AM & Thursdays 3PM to 4PM. We did this and can strongly recommend this as very worthwhile.

JenJenSydney	Old world charm	"Like stepping back in time! Gorgeous grand hotel, beautiful architecture. A little tired but still charming. Enjoyed the saltwater pool right on the ocean edge. Breakfast was amazing. Rooms were a decent size and well equipped with a complimentary mini bar which was appreciated. Sunset cocktails are a must and the staff were exceptional. We loved Keeth who ensured our room was clean and tidy and that we had everything we needed. The only downfall was on first arrival we were not welcomed in the way we had found we were at every other hotel in this beautiful country. We had come off a hot train trip and found our arrival unwelcoming which was disappointing. Apart from that, we enjoyed our stay and the staff were lovely. And thank you to the Stone the Crow man!!!"

The property is massive, carefully cared for, and very well staffed. We absolutely loved our breakfast and the FB staff could not have been kinder and more professional.  The only slip up really was the FO staff who did not check our room preferences made months in advance so getting the room sorted for our little one to take a nap was a bit of a nuisance, but otherwise we did love the room we were given.  Better yet, we highly recommend getting Long Room access as the afternoon tea and sunset cocktails were perfect.  We will most certainly be back!"	Date of stay: January 2020

Very attentive staff , Chaya made sure all our needs were met from our airport pick up to ensuring transport was available to to take us to the office every morning.

Atle Totland	A unique historic hotel with lots of charm	"Galle Face hotel in Colombo is one of the oldest hotels in Asia, built in 1864 during the colonial times. The hotel was gently and respectfully renovated a few years ago and has kept the charm and qualities of yesteryear.   As you enter the lobby, you may be met by the bright smile of Pawani or the ever-friendly Mohamed Siddique. You immediately know that the stay will be pleasantly memorable.   Galle Face offers a unique charm, atmosphere and traditions which other top modern and spotless luxury hotels can never provide.  Atle Totland"	Date of stay: January 2020
HannahB	Lovely Hotel but shame about the party	"We stayed at this hotel for a short time, en route to the airport from our main holiday on the south coast. The Hotel rooms and facilities are wonderful and the staff are great but ...for gods sake make sure you do not book a room that is close to the function room if they have a function on.  We were in the function with the party although in our bedroom.  Such a great shame.  Would have loved to give 5 stars but can hardly give 3.  I think the hotel needs to decide if it is a party place or a up market hotel for visitors."	Date of stay: February 2020
phc27	Colonial Style added to our two week business trip.	"The hotel is a mix of classic Colonial style mixed with modern day great service and comfort. Room was immaculately clean and well kept, the food was amazing in the variety and choice.  Breakfast sets you up for the day, endless hoppers and choices to accompany them.  Did draw the line at the 5 curries on offer at breakfast. The only caution is the service at the Mambo Bar which was the only disappointment.    Elsewhere the service throughout the hotel is always above and beyond the norm.  Looking forward to our next 2 week stay - in a weeks time."	Date of stay: January 2020

Travelin' Pam	"Historic, Old-World Charm at the Waterfront"	"Following laid-back stays along the southern coast and Ella, the Galle Face Hotel was a bit of culture shock. This is a large hotel that can come off a bit stuffy at first. After we settled in, we found the hotel to have its own charm. Our guest room (#4017) was large, comfortable and well appointed. Good a/c and wifi. The huge buffet breakfast with omelet/hopper bar was excellent.   The waterfront veranda was our favorite part of the hotel. Watching the bagpiper and the lowering of the Sri Lankan flag at sunset was very special.   Least favorite aspects were the street noise and the fact that this grand old hotel is showing its age (perhaps contributing to its charm). The lack of wash cloths at a luxury hotel seemed a bit unusual.  That said, we would stay at the Galle Face"	Date of stay: February 2020

Mike S	"Pompous, Unhelpful Staff"	"Stayed here as part of our twelve day tour of Sri Lanka. Our room had been booked by our travel agent, who requested and paid for a sea view. On arrival, the reception staff were very unhelpful, aloof and pompous. Clearly there is a “pecking order” at this hotel - those paying the most get treated the best. Eventually, the staff agreed that our room had been allocated to another couple and no other was available. Furthermore the staff gave no information regarding facilities, options, meal times etc. Having had a drink at the bar I asked to sign for the cost which I duly did. My signature was not accepted as reception staff had failed to ask for a credit card on arrival. A truly embarrassing incident resulting in another complaint and faint apology.

The disappointment of having to rearrange our flights to Oz soon faded as we enjoyed our time here. The hotel position on the front keeps you away from all of the construction work going on around many of the other hotels. There are several good restaurants on site from local to Cuban (with a wonderful Latin soundtrack)and afternoon tea on the veranda is a real treat with a piper at sundown.

Little did we know what a treat we would receive by staying there.  The hotel is beautiful and is on the Indian Ocean.  The restaurants are varied and delicious - especially the veranda restaurant which serves delicious buffets all day.  The rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed.  Ours had a great view to the ocean as well as the boardwalk.  The service is wonderful and the staff is so friendly and nice.  I want to give a special shoutout to the staff historian: Mr. Mohamed Siddique who gave us a tour of the museum (yes they have an amazing historical museum) and the hotel.  Everything was perfect.

IRELANDSMAN	THE OLD LADY IS SHOWING HER AGE	"It has been 45 years since last in the Galle Face Hotel--then it was truly special. Now much of the charm and grandeur is quickly fading., Huge investment is required to bring it into line with modern international Hotels as Raffles has done. Some of the rooms i saw were so small and totally run down and overpriced. The staff ratio of staff to guests is going to be a big issue for the new Spanish General Manager who will arrive next week. Food is not what one gets in a 5* hotel-- a far greater effort needs to be made by the chefs.  The absence of fresh fish both at Breakfast and Dinner --this is unacceptable. Historically polite people spoke quietly in the Galle Face unlike the loudness of some Americans i witnessed on my 2 recent stays.Other guests are not interested in their"	Date of stay: January 2020

Alex	Leisure trip	"We enjoyed our brief trip to galle face. If you’re looking for accommodation with character and history, galle face overlooking the sea is the place for you. What made our trip experience extra special were the gym training sessions we  with Shane Peterson, a trainer who would be could compete with the best around the world. We were impressed with the dinner selection - nice array of Sri Lankan dishes. The staff were every friendly and let us check out late.  The only reason we cannot give this five stars is because of the loud noise from the ballroom that kept us up until midnight and then woke us up in the morning. This hotel is popular for weddings so choose your room wisely and find Shane for a workout if you can!"	Date of stay: January 2020
ninalondon2018	Incredible service and mind blowing breakfast	"This hotel has all the old world colonial charm, the architecture is beautiful and it's right on the ocean.  I booked an ocean view suite as I wanted to treat myself for my final night in Sri Lanka and it was beautiful; with balcony overlooking the sea and a four poster bath (!) and bed in the room.  Sadly at about 9pm I heard some noise from a function which was being held at the hotel. I informed reception and the Lobby Manager, Dhanuka, couldn't have done enough to assist. He was so supportive (I was travelling alone) and made me feel really well looked after, he listened to the noise and then upgraded me to one of the Royal Suites. I didn't even have to kick up a massive fuss, he just sorted it out. I didn't know service like this still existed - all the thanks in the world."	Date of stay: January 2020
Sue Stapely	lovely old fashioned hotel	"We spent two nights in the Galle Face at the start of our tour of Sri Lanka and liked it a lot, particularly as we had been allocated a large room on the 3rd floor with our own large balcony with sun loungers and table and chairs with a view of the ocean. The hotel is a classic in many ways and the rooms are not as up-to-date as some might like but we appreciated the good service, comfort of the large bed with excellent linen and choice of foods.  The only irritations were the room was too dark to read with ease and we are voracious readers, and as a grand wedding was taking place on one of the two nights we stayed, there was a limited number of eating options as the main restaurant area was taken over by the wedding party. The breakfast was excellent and we would recommend it."	Date of stay: January 2020
J S	Amazing Hotel and even better concierge	"They hotel is fantastic old colonial building on the coast. We stayed for 2 nights and when we had to leave trying to book trains or taxis was extremely confusing, however Emmanuel the concierge was a MASSIVE help. He called the train station and spoke to taxi drivers to get a great deal travelling to Kandy. Genuinely without his help we would have paid over the top and spent a lot of our precious holiday time trying to workout a plan. Also I txted him about the recipe for the kingfish curry at the hotel (which is one of the best curry I have ever had) he was so kind and got the chef to do an email with the recipe and the cooking instructions.  Really recommend this hotel and go speak to Emmanuel if you have any questions about your trip to Sri Lanka. Great addition to this"	Date of stay: January 2020
Prasanna M	Colonial Hotel in Colombo	A great Colonial era Hotel still standing depicting it's status. They got it good Seafood restaurant by the sea. You can have a Cool beer in the evening to Cool off in this warm city.  I have not stayed at this hotel but I believe the rooms are large. They got a new wing too.  Good place to visit and have some seafood.	Date of stay: March 2019
AlexSkinner	Loved it - my favourite of the trip so far	"Classic hotel with a very colonial appearance, lots of wood, a wide sprawling building with a beautiful view over the sea. A bagpiper plays Highland Cathedral as the Sri Lankan flag is brought down in the evenings in a very traditional ceremony (not sure why the bagpipes but he's a decent player). The food is hands down the best of the trip so far, a broad array of delicious Sri Lankan food. The restaurant is part outdoors part under cover with plenty of ceiling fans if needed to keep cool. Nice cocktails, friendly service. Well worth a visit."	Date of stay: January 2020
Anjula T	Beautiful hotel	This is a beautiful colonial hotel right on the beach. It is very traditional which we loved. We liked the ambience in the bar. Our room was large and the beds very comfortable.   The breakfast was delicious. Lots of choice. We would definitely stay here again	Date of stay: January 2020
Peeyush Arya	It was a great stay	The receptionist was very kind to upgrade me to a suite. The walk to the suite on the 4th floor seemed like going past a museum with old paintings and lot of history on display. The room was clean and comfortable. Enjoyed the morning by the sea shore in the hotel. Only suggestion would be to provide more international plugpoints in the room. Superb stay.	Date of stay: January 2020
CaraAdelaide	Love to stay at this wonderful hotel!	"This is our fourth visit to Sri Lanka and our third stay at the Galle Face Hotel.  We love staying here, the staff are friendly and efficient, the rooms and views are great, the pool on the edge of the Indian Ocean is very special and the food is excellent.  But it's the ambience of the place that is so lovely - first night back in the tropics and there's nothing like a beer and a cocktail overlooking the Indian Ocean with the warm breezes and the anticipation of some great curry for dinner!  Thanks to everyone at Galle Face for making our time with you so special!"	Date of stay: November 2019

Colin B	Living on past glories	To be fair our welcome on arrival was good and the room we were allocated was spacious well equipped with some nice touches such as chocolates and fruit. We were however far less impressed when the used the bars and restaurants. The hotel has more than enough staff but those in the bars seem more intent on trying to avoid work rather than serving. In an empty pool bar we waited 20 minutes after receiving the menus before we found someone to take our order. This lack of attention was repeated on a number of occasions in various locations. The food we ordered was average at best and very disappointing. The exception was the Inn on the Green which with live music and good service was great. We asked for a wake up call at 6.15am to catch our flight but this never materialised.	Date of stay: January 2020

NandR	Impromptu lunch at the Travellers' Bar	"We were passing by and called in for lunch, sitting outside on the balcony at the Travellers' Bar. The ambiance and views went someway to ameliorating the disappointing half an hour wait and the simultaneous delivery of our soup and main course. The food was enjoyable and reasonably priced for such a hotel and location. We would return."	Date of stay: January 2020
kasrobrob	This is a World Class Hotel - Outsanding in every way	"We just stayed here twice in the last couple of weeks, for a total of 5 days.  We are extensive world travelers, and found the Galle Face to be among the very best hotels we've ever stayed in.  And when you consider the value, it rises to the top.  We give them excellent ratings in every category - the staff is outstanding and incredibly accommodating, the spa is fantastic, the food amazingly good, the grounds beautiful and well kept, the condition of the hotel excellent, while totally retaining its colonial charm, the location can't be beat.   The Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai has nothing on this place, and the prices here are a lot more reasonable.  Truly world class!"	Date of stay: January 2020
AnnaDownUnder	Beautiful colonial style hotel	"Public areas are stunning and the pool was a highlight for me as you can sit facing the ocean and the pool itself is cool, deep and clean - absolutely loved it.  Room was underwhelming. We were in the newer section with a large balcony. Room itself is small, bed was the smallest we’d had in SL and not overly comfortable. Also saw the older wing as friends were staying there and suite was massive but not modern and therefore appeared a little dated - really depends on the type of experience you want - interestingly our friends asked to be changed into one of the updated rooms.  Hubby got sick while we were there and hotel were great in organising Dr C to attend our room. Very comprehensive review and measures in place to ensure he had a more comfortable transit home as we were"	Date of stay: January 2020
Sujeewe Rupasinghe	Horrible Experience	"We are a family(2 kids self and wife) living oversees, just as every year end we come home for Christmas vacation.  We were staying in the hotel and experienced worst ever stay in a hotel. Check in was reasonably fast but staff mostly prioritize foreigners. Welcome dirks served only to all foreigners. Door men open doors  only for white skinned.    Being a local and  having a sound understanding of the difficulties industry passing through, we tolerated most but the night and morning experience was very bad thus this note. We were booked in a mini suite and found cockroaches in kids bed. Not few many were ruling the room through the night.  Around midnight we made 3 calls to receptions all 3 times line was cutoff intentionally.   The waiters were very good and friendly. They"	Date of stay: December 2019

vanitap929	Needs of a vegetarian	"We stayed at this beautiful hotel earlier in January 2020. It is located on the sea front. Only one problem. We went down to dinner in the evening, only to be told that it was ""seafood friday"". One of our party members was a vegetarian. When she asked the chef about options for vegetarians, his response was ""mash potato and boiled vegetables"". We were appalled at this response and complained to the restaurant manager, who after arguing, offered vegetable biriani. This arrived after 20 minutes and it was rice, topped with boiled vegetables and half cooked pappadoms! Need less to day, this ruined our evening. They obviously did not cater well for the vegetarians!"	Date of stay: January 2020

joannalan	Fabulous hotel	A real step into the colonial past in this beautiful hotel.  Very well maintained and kept up.   There’s nothing like a cocktail at the pool watching the sun go down.   Terrific service from the staff.  Somehow they knew that we were leaving early and they had a packed breakfast waiting for us at checkout.   And a great breakfast buffet.  Very good egghoppers.    Lovely place to end a two week holiday in Sri Lanka.	Date of stay: January 2020

Putneyhill	Amazing location tired hotel in need of TLC.	"Don't get me wrong sitting on the lawn watching the sunset over the sea is amazing and the the hotel looks beautiful.    But the rooms and interiors are gloomy - old scruffy and tired not what you would expect for the 5 star prices being charged.   Yes it is a heritage hotel but that does not mean that everything has to stay the same - it needs to be refreshed.  The F&B is also tired and odd.  Basically you can have a buffet of Sri Lankan food, or a tiny Ala carte choice of the usual hotel stuff or you can eat in the Cuban (yes really) restaurant.  The Sri Lankan buffet is excellent but do you want to eat a buffet every night?  I would expect that in the oldest Grandest Hotel in Colombo would have an extensive ala carte menu of fine international and Sri Lankan food."	Date of stay: January 2020
zalishariff	An iconic must-stay-at hotel	"Colombo today offers a huge selection of hotels to suit all budgets. On the plusher side you have a wide choice of several leading 4 and 5 star international chains, as well as several local luxury hotels. In this diversity is also the over hundred years old iconic Galle Face hotel, ideally located on the seafront on Galle Road, one of the principal thoroughfares of Colombo, and with the popular Beach Park right next to it. Most major city attractions are a healthy walk or a short taxi ride away. The accommodation of choice in Colombo over the decades of international royalty, dignitaries and celebrities, the hotel has been completely renovated in recent years to capture back its past glory. The classical architecture complemented by equally classical interior décor takes you"	Date of stay: December 2019

We truly enjoyed the historical landmark and the colonial style of the hotel in comparison to super modern style hotels. Service was very good, always greeted with a smile. Food (breakfast, lunch and dinner) was good and tasty. Rooms clean and well equipped. Could be good to have more modern electrical outlets with universal fitting."	Date of stay: January 2020
David B	A wonderful stay to end our holiday in Sri Lanka	Nothing was too much trouble for the excellent team at the Galle Face. We mentioned a query around finding one of the bars and were given a personal tour of the hotel. We were upgraded from balcony room the the Ceylon Suite which certainly helped the experience as well. There are other very nice hotels along the Galle Face road but none have the history and character of this old colonial gem.	Date of stay: January 2020
Andrew A	A Moment in Post British Colonial Era	"I didn't have any expectation when my Mom booked this hotel but upon arrival, I was transported to the Post Colonial British era. This is the prime example of a timeless and classic, yet modest hotel. It happens to be one of the oldest hotels in the world - built in 1864 and several dignitaries (past and present) have stayed here - the breadth of the types of people who have experienced this hotel is so diverse and impressive.   If you are looking for Post British Colonial design, architecture and vibe, then this is the hotel for you. It sits right on the ocean with the pool overlooking the Indian ocean. There is British High Tea every day from 4 pm - 6 pm with live music (very classy) and at sunset, a bag piper plays from the outdoor High Tea area to the end of the platform as"	Date of stay: January 2020

Cindy B	Charming Stay	"I picked this hotel because of its interesting history, and the charming photos of the room and property were true to the experience. The hotel was well-kept and clean. I had an ocean view room as the side of the hotel, but closer to the road. It was a bit noisy during the evening, but I found that closing the drapes worked well to muffle the traffic noise. It's a great location on the ocean and short walk to city points of interest (Galle Face Green, Fort, etc). Swimming in the saltwater pool with a view of the ocean was a perfect way to cool off during the heat of the day. Friendly staff and great service!"	Date of stay: December 2019

Galle Face is an old charm colonial hotel. It has a gallery of the oldest most beautiful paintings and a bar which played host to many famous people including Prince Charles that have stayed at the hotel .

The two days that we spent there were replete with warm, smiling, genial hospitality which seems to be a hallmark of Sri Lankan hosting.  We were particularly well attended to by Geetika and her colleague Darshni in F&B which made all the difference between an ordinary repast and an extraordinary one! The hotel is arguably at the best sea facing location in Colombo and we had a very relaxing and refreshing two days stay there before embarking on our escapade across Sri Lanka.

TravellerLK	Classy Bungalow Hotel	Good place to be when you wanna feel good all about Colombos Rice and Curry..Hot finger foods and a great afternoon sundowner. It serves great grub n drinks at Verandah besides the buffet. Rooms are bit crampy and rigid I would say. Furniture very rustic style and design is old style. Junior suite we stayed but dissapointed. Overall one stay in a lifetime I would say. Would sure visit for a meal n drink but not stay as I believe rates and hotel is overrated. It sure has a historical valur 100% which is treasured.

Jon	Mr	"Despite being extremely happy with the hotel location and staff, I was not happy that I was denied entry to the dining room in the evening because of a birthday party.  I had to eat in my room which was not what I expected nor wanted.  I was also informed that breakfast was included in the price which to my surprise it wasn’t.  The fact I couldn’t eat in the dining room actually marred my stay there at the hotel and tainted what was a splendid holiday in Sri Lanka.   I have written to Galle Face but have not received a reply or an explanation."	Date of stay: December 2019
CenturyLondon	Colonial style at its Best	This was our fifth stay at the Galle Face - first came here in 1993. What a great location on the ocean - try to get an ocean view room. The Travellers Bar is full of pictures of celebrities who have stayed here over the years from Noel Cowerd to Harrison Ford - many have cocktails named after them. Perhaps the best part is a cold beer on the veranda watching the sun set over the ocean. And we have to say the people working here are most charming and helpful. We'll be back.

Free Spirit	Stunning. Like stepping back in time. A must. Timeless and atmospheric.	This is a must in Colombo. It's like stepping back in time. Beautiful grounds and well kept. Security is tight so you and your bags will be thoroughly checked. Staff are friendly. Go at sunset. The views and ambience are breathtaking. You can have the famous afternoon tea as well or you can just have a drink and watch the sunset. Go upstairs as well as there is a little museum with memorabilia and information on famous people that have visited. I would suggest doing what we did and go after a day sightseeing as the sun sets. You can then take a walk on the green outside and take in the local life or grab a bite to eat.	Date of stay: December 2019

I spent several hours at the pool side bar staring put out at the ocean and enjoying a few cocktails.  The bars/restaurants on premises is quite good and the food was not bad at all.  It is close to a lot of places and things to see and I fully enjoyed my stay here.  Just a few notes for tourists:  If a local starts being very friendly and tells you about a festival or Something like that which is “only on today” it is a scam and they will try and get as much money as possible out of you. Rather take the tuk tuk safari.  You cannot tip when you pay with your card, only cash tips are"	Date of stay: December 2019

Booked an expensive sea front room with balcony a year in advance to be sure .. especially to view the incomparable sunsets.    On arrival a lot of shuffling of feet at reception and told to  sit down. Told delay was because the passport scanner was slow.

We love to stay at the Galle Face Hotel for many reasons, not the least of which is its high standard of service. From greeting to departure one is made to feel extremely well cared for and attended to. Crisp handsome uniforms with white glove service, and beautiful smiles in beautiful saris, all of the staff are superb.   The rooms are finely appointed, with rich dark wooden floors, lovely draperies, fine rugs, and plenty of space in which to relax from the heat of the day.

Patricia M	In With the Old	Use your imagination to picture what it would have been like to stay with British royalty in Colombo. This hotel Is old and if you look closely untouched you can see that it needs a face lift. But the service is world class and so what if the elevator may not be working. We arrived in the middle of the night and the staff were at the ready to take care of us. And having gin and tonics in the old bar is a must. Brand hotels are under construction but you might as well stay home if you stay there. Enjoy what used to be.	Date of stay: November 2019

Buffet breakfast was included in our deal and had everything (egg station, fruits, cereal, Asian, pancakes, salads, pastries etc).  Coffee was ok but we are in a tea drinking country - no complaints.  Pool area was good but some birds didn’t like guests using some of the lounges.... plenty of lounges and towels.  Restaurant served good food and cocktails around $8. We did the hotel history tour which was interesting.  All staff friendly and happy !

The library was a well equipped hall to have a workshop, uninterrupted wifi was available through out the 4 days, laptop charging facilities were provided for each table, adequate water botttles provided for each session. Room facilities were superb, had a good view of the beach. The buffet provided a range of food and even for the workshop the food provided for tea break had a good variety.  overall it was an unforgettable experience."	Date of stay: December 2019
Jennifer Cameron	Excellent Service!	"We are totally satisfied with our stay at Galle Face Hotel. My brother and his wife were enthralled by the prettiness and exquisiteness of this place. The ocean was majestic too. The staff is friendly, the foods are great, and the rooms are superb."	Date of stay: November 2019
Saarah Hassen	Best Breakfast Buffet	"A good selection of a range of items for breakfast. Their food is fresh and healthy. A range of pastries, cereals, milks, juices, Sri Lankan dishes and other cuisines. The ambience is relaxing as it is an open restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating near the ocean. The interiors of this hotel are vintage and have a lot of character"	Date of stay: December 2019
Paul B	Globally fine	My stay was fine. The hotel has a certain character due to his history.  The view and the service are both amazing.  However the rooms are VERY noisy and there is nothing we can do about that. The good point is the restaurant King of the Mambo where the atmosphere and food are amazing	Date of stay: December 2019
tomfor2	Colonial charm (but they need to try harder)	"I stayed for several days at the Galle Face hotel. My general impression is that they rely on the heritage nature of the hotel as their main selling point, but that is not enough. Service can definitely be improved, it is not up to the standards of 5-star Asian hotels. If the hotels improves service and cleanliness, it can be up there in the big leagues. Plus: the charm, the Cuban bar, the sunsets by the pool Minus: The spa area, the cockroaches in the room"	Date of stay: November 2019
Charles R	Great location.	Stayed at this hotel in September and October this year on my way to the interior. Front office staff young but very helpful and welcoming.  Two of the bellman that had worked there a while were really awesome. Sorry I don’t remember their names.  Restaurant staff and management at breakfast not so service oriented. Seemed stressed out and not willing to oblige the customer with personal requests.  Rooms not that great even after all the renovations. Furniture is mismatched and all over the place. Sockets likewise not convenient to use.	Date of stay: October 2019

Tlyman	Grand Colonial Majesty	"My wife an I stayed at this hotel and loved it!  It is a grand, colonial style hotel with lots of charm and is reminiscent of the colonial period in Sri Lanka.  It is well maintained, and the service is great!  Located right on the ocean, we could see the breakers and hear them crashing on the beach from our room.  The restaurant overlooks a small garden and then the ocean.  There is a small museum with information on the colonial period, wonderful photos, and a spacious library to enjoy.  If you are looking for some history from the British colonial period, an elegant and comfortable place to stay, and great service, you will love this hotel."	Date of stay: November 2019
SuitcaseTales	Disappointing Policies and Management	"Having stayed at some wonderful hotels in Sri Lanka during stay, we were looking forward to the colonial ambience of Galle Face.  Upon check in, we were asked to present our credit card to be charged up front US$150!!  I know it is customary for an imprint to be taken but this was both rude and ridiculous - not a great start to our stay.  It soon became apparent that the poor staff really don't know where things are and what is happening outside of their immediate area.  Management really needs to address these deficiencies in both policy and service.  This hotel could be so much more akin to The Raffles or Imperial but it's colonial glory has faded.  Please breathe some life back into this old gem."	Date of stay: November 2019
Chemist1956	A Touch of the Colonial Days	What a beautiful hotel in the old classical style. Friendly helpful staff. Large clean rooms with modern bathrooms. Views out over the ocean from the sea view rooms. Bar and buffet style resturant efficent and good value. 5 star standards but not 5 star costs.	Date of stay: November 2019
John G	Visit to Galle Face Hotel	"Sadly, we only spent one night in the Galle Face Hotel. But, it is a beautiful experience in a wonderful old traditional hotel. We chose to eat in the bar and we’re not disappointed. Our curry was excellent and the service friendly and unobtrusive. The room was very traditional yet comfortable, with solid old wooden furniture. The hotel museum is interesting, reflecting its illustrious past and present guest list. Overall, an excellent experience and highly recommended."	Date of stay: November 2019

Sumithran	Charming heritage hotel	"The hotel is located on the busy Galle Face Road on the beach. So do expect some traffic especially if one is coming to the hotel in the peak office hours. The room had a sleeping area which further lead to a seating cum study. The room also had a view facing the interior rooftops and so probably missed the more scenic views. The overall lighting in the room is quite poor and the room has a window only in the seating area. The bathroom has a huge step, which one has to climb to go in. This may be quite a burden for the older persons (forget the wheelchairs). Wifi was very good. The staff are very helpful and cordial. Breakfast is served in the open air (but covered) verandah by the seaside. There is huge variety of local and continental dishes and the taste is excellent. I also"	Date of stay: November 2019
Kate NS	Excellent - a taste of history	"We stayed only one night and wished we’d been able to stay longer. The staff were very friendly and the service was fantastic. We had a lovely suite with sea views. The sunset drinks are worth heading down for and the food in the Cuban restaurant is excellent and David, our waiter looked after us very well!!! I would definitely recommend this place."	Date of stay: November 2019

Elna S	Giving up without a fight	"I had high expectations of this place before my visit. Hotels with history and tradition in Asia are often synonymous with luxury and great style. It seems that this place has given up in the shadows of the high rises of the Grand Hyatt, J.W. Marriott, Ritz Carlton and the like. This made me sad, because it has soooo much potential and it seems no one is willing to make the effort (and investment) to make this place the number one address in Sri Lanka it claims to be. They are lucky the staff is sensational and fantastic hosts!"	Date of stay: November 2019

mysvar	Enquiry	Rang reception to find out about facilities for a disabled person. Reception insisted that wheelchairs available and a ramp to assist. Obviously she did not know what wheelchairs or a ramp are. Wheelchairs yes. Ramp no. This is supposed to be a star class hotel???? With no ramp. Educate your front office staff because it would have been so tough if I turned up for the reception with wheelchair guest in tow.	Date of stay: November 2019

"The Galle Face Hotel has a charm and elegance All of it’s own with lovely and attentive staff and a fabulous variety of areas to eat and drink in peaceful comfort. Drinks by the great pool, lunch on the terrace, cocktails on the lawn, and the breakfast has the best array of options we have experienced anywhere. Highly recommend."	Date of stay: November 2019

Liane C	Historical charm and excellent service	"This was our second visit to the Galle Face Hotel in two years and our stay was just as memorable as the first. We were upgraded to a suite with a stunning view overlooking the sea for our wedding anniversary. The room itself was excellent, and even included its own jacuzzi! While some of the furnishings around the wider hotel are looking a little tired that adds to the charm of this historic hotel and the service is really what makes this place - the staff are always helpful and make you feel like an honoured guest. Even if you don't stay here, I'd recommend visiting the bar at sunset for a well made cocktail on the verandah overlooking the sea...it's a view you never tire of!"	Date of stay: November 2019

Ahmed Hamdhoon	"Old hotel, good location"	Stayed here for a conference. Old building touched up nicely. Rooms were spacious and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The restaurant unfortunately does not reflect this. There is a lot of vatiety at the buffet but most are Sri Lankan varieties and in my 2 nights there the dinner buffet mainly had the same food. Would be great if they can put a bit more international varieties.	Date of stay: November 2019

kostam2000	Incompetent and unprofessional reservation	"It is really a shame that such a legendary hotel suffers from such incompetent and unacceptable service. I contacted reservation directly via email because I had specific requests concerning my booking. I had checked the price online, but did not want to book it automatically because I needed to clarify certain issues. After sending them two emails nobody bothered to answer me. I sent a third email and then I was contacted by the Senior Reservations Executive, Ms Sheshani [-]. She just informed me about the price per night and attached the credit card authorization form, without even clarifying if the full amount has to be paid via credit card or just a deposit. She also completely ignored my other questions concerning the room. Then I wrote back once again, asking about all"	Date of stay: November 2019
AnilPerera	Very Beautiful hotel by the sea	"This hotel is ageless. It has beautiful 19th century architecture. The rooms are rather musty and old fashioned. The food is ok, but other hotels such as Cinnamon Grand and Kingsbury have much better buffets at reasonable rates. A caution for visitors. Use cash for any payment at this hotel. This is the only hotel I used my Chase credit card while visiting Sri Lanka. Upon returning to the US, there was a fraud alert on my credit card. Somebody had tried to use my credit card number from Sri Lanka. It had to be somebody from this hotel."	Date of stay: December 2018
sanchezsmith	Can't get enough of this hotel!!!	"We keep coming back to this hotel and the experience just gets better and better. If you are past the backpack and youth hostel point in your life and just want to be treated like  a grown up this is the place for you. On arrival you are greeted with ice cold lemonade to revive you from the trip from the airport. Also with some Sri Lankan caramels that are obviously the BEST in the world. The rooms are great. We splurged and got a room with a HUGE balcony overlooking the Indian Ocean. (I had a hotel room in Zurich once that was way smaller than the balcony here. Hell, it was smaller than the shower here.)   The hotel has a buffet breakfast and dinner that goes on for miles, but at the end of the day we like to get a light dinner in the veranda off the bar. I recommend the fish"	Date of stay: November 2019
EasygoingOz	Amazing place	"Stayed 5 days and loved it. Amazing building with a lot of history. Renovated tastefully. Nice comfortable room. Food in the restaurants was very good. Great location on the sea. Only suggestion is not to sleep in a room above the Mambo King restaurant as the music is quite loud, especially the bass, and it goes on till late. Staff are really friendly and provide excellent service."	Date of stay: November 2019
Vasiha Begum	Galle Face is the glory of Colombo	"The hotel takes you back in time and depicts the historical glory of Sri Lanka. Our room was facing the sea. From the window we could watch the roaring waves lashing at the feet of the hotel.  The hotel has a museum and every nook and corner of the building is food for thought. Art and Craft and warm hospitality of the housekeeping makes your stay very comfortable. Every evening the salute to the flag with the bagpipe player is very majestic.  The staff is very kind and welcoming.  Just be very careful with your room key so you don't lose it, as USD 150 is the fine for lost key. We were in room 2044 which is a large room, a bit noisy in the night because of the restaurant on the beach. For us it was not a problem at all."	Date of stay: October 2019

From the moment we arrived, the security and professionalism displayed by all departments, was always of the highest standards. We felt safe and extremely well looked after throughout our assignment, despite the ongoing concerns that we faced.  The quality of the hotel and its staff remained 5 star throughout, especially the concierge gentleman who couldn’t do enough for us not only during our stay, but after we left.   To the manager and his team, thank you from all at CNN, let’s hope the next time we stay with you, it will be under different circumstances."	Date of stay: April 2019

Service is excellent and food is definitely well done."	Date of stay: October 2019

peternakan	Colombo the easy way	If your agent says they can’t book this jump onto the website and book it yourself. The Galle Face Hotel has a grand but understated  historic charm and elegance.  Enjoy breakfast under lazily  spinning fans and an outlook over the harbour.  It has a wonderful lap length pool facing the ocean front so you can refresh after a busy day at the museum or day trip down to Galle Fort.  It’s worth it.	Date of stay: November 2018
James R	There are better options	"I'd simply say that the hotel needs a refresh. There are many examples of hotels which successfully keep the character and history of a building intact (Firmdale properties in London, as an example), but bring it up to a modern standard. Unfortunately Galle Face is not one of those properties. Whilst the front of house is very inviting, the rest of the hotel is simply tired and dated.  On the bright side, the staff are (as ever in Sri Lanka) amazingly friendly, warm and welcoming. The breakfast buffet was fantastic and the view over the ocean was very relaxing to wake up to."

And the one outstanding takeaway from our stay in Sri Lanka has to be the hospitality of the hotel staff and indeed everybody we encountered in Sri Lanka. From immigration and customs officer, to the hotel driver, right down to the doorman, restaurant staff, housekeeping, front office, chefs, Barmen....they’re just too numerous to name.  Even if you’re not staying at the hotel, it is worth a visit to have a sandwich and drink at the traveller’s bar.  To walk through the corridors of this grand hotel brings you back to the days of hand delivered messages by boys wearing pillbox cap.

paiJagdish	Beautiful memories	"I enjoyed my stay at the Galle Face Hotel late  October . The staff - particularly the Concierge & front desk were incredibly helpful. I have stayed at multiple historic hotels throughout the U.S. and India. The Galle Face, however, beats them all. I stayed in the Junior Suite and was able to take advantage of the historic part of the building with its original flooring, high ceilings, and view looking out on the Green. I felt much closer to the history and story of the building at the Galle Face Hotel.  it is a luxury experience in an historic hotel. My time at the Galle Face Hotel will set the bar for my future hotel stays and I highly doubt anyone will meet it.The staff was so helpful. The food was fantastic."	Date of stay: October 2019

Athukumara	Great Place to Stay and Great Staff with super service	This is actually about how our booking queries were handled by the telephone operator Ms. Shyamali at the time who was very confident and had a good knowledge of all aspects of the hotel which made my day and gave me a good first impression of the hotel even before checking in. She was very friendly and conversed well in English and was always never rushing our calls. She knew a lot about all the restaurants and the offers as well as room rates and other promotions.  Keep up the good work and always treasure your staff like this as they are the backbone of such a prestigious hotel.	Date of stay: August 2019

It has a graceful dignity about it that some other grand hotels in Asia of the colonial era lack, and I love its fabulous retro salt water swimming pool. This most recent visit, we were in a Landmark Queen room and were lucky to have a sea view and verandah. The bed was very comfortable, the amenities good, and the Sri Lankan breakfast, delicious.

The facilities were otherwise superior, and offerings (e.g. massages and happy hours etc) were good. We were disappointed to find out the 1864 restaurant was closed to group bookings only; that limited our dining options. The King of Mambo was fantastic, however, in terms of food, drinks and overall vibe. We walked in to In...On The Green but walked straight out as it wreaked of cigarettes (think dank 1980s pub).  Overall, however, the hotel was beautiful and we would most definitely stay here again."	Date of stay: September 2019

janineor	Disappointing service	We recently stayed 1 night at the end of a 2 week tour of beautiful Sri Lanka and were a bit disappointed. The hotel was busy with many people attending a conference staying there but that doesn’t excuse the lack of service. Right from the beginning when we asked directions to our room and just had the stairs pointed out to us and left to find our own way. Service and food at the dinner and breakfast buffets was also poor with us having to ask for tea and coffee many times and clear our own plates. Some of the food was over cooked and the selection was not great. On a positive note the location and building are great and our corner room was lovely although we couldn’t get the shower quite hot enough and the air conditioner was a bit too cold.

The flowers, by the way, were gorgeous.   I have stayed at multiple historic hotels throughout the U.S. and Europe. The Galle Face, however, beats them all.

Arriving early, we were able to check in at noon and our request for a late checkout was granted easily. We had the room until 2pm and could store our bags with the concierge until our airport pickup at 9pm.  We requested a quiet room and got one. The best two nights’ sleep of our trip, in a heavenly bed.  The snacks and soft drinks in the mini-bar were complimentary, as was the breakfast, which was impressive. We had afternoon tea on our first day. At just LKR3000 for the two of us, it was a steal.  We just couldn’t find fault with this four-star hotel.

Hilary B	Good overall. A few disappointments.	It was lovely to come back to stay for 3 nights and I really enjoyed the stay. I liked my room and loved the view of the sea and terrace. I was however disappointed by the change in the view - not the fault of the Hotel and out of their hands- as there are now large cranes all on the harbour section and overly tall buildings all around GFH. There were a few things also within the environment  that need attention: the path by the sea needs mending and is blocked off with unsightly plastic tape; some building work by the pool did not make swimming a very relaxing experience. I slightly missed the changed lobby and eccentric board that used to be up but actually the new lobby was very nice. Even the electric scanner in it blended in OK and staff were very welcoming. Staff were	Date of stay: August 2019
Chris L	5 nights of pure luxury	"From the moment we stepped into the spacious front-desk area everything was ultra-smooth. A welcome lemon/ginger iced drink while we checked in. Premium room in the west wing, complete with an in-room Jacuzzi/bath and overlooking the sea-water swimming pool. Charming hotel and staff. Superb colonial style terrace for breakfast (and other meals). The hotel really is something special, even has signs asking you be respectful of other guests when using mobile phones and keep use to a minimum)."	Date of stay: September 2018

From the moment we arrived the service was excellent from the check in team to the  staff at breakfast . Our room was a spacious, colonial style room and had everything we could possible need. The bathroom was beautiful . The swimming pool is in a spectacular spot overlooking the  sea and is very inviting on a hot day. We had late  afternoon cocktails in the outside bar and it was a lovely relaxing place to unwind after a long day. Breakfast was an incredible feast and although they offered everything you could  possibly want, we couldn't go past the magnificent Sri Lankan breakfast offerings.  The range was  extensive and delicious . The coffee was also very good ( which is a bit"	Date of stay: August 2019

Yamuna A	Spoiled by the dinner	"I booked this hotel based on the reviews and was really looking forward to staying here. The hotel itself is nice and the staff too were good.We were happy with our room. However we  were very disappointed with the food quality that was served as part of the half board we had booked for,in fact the Thai food my husband ordered at dinner was appalling and unpalatable.There was no effort to make up for this and it definitely put a damper on what would have an  been a good stay. Having just come from the Galle Fort Hotel In Galle which had impeccable food and an unbelievable level of service we are leaving Lanka with a feeling of being let down at he end of our holiday."

They sensed my interest in the hotel's impressive history and they offered details that I would not find elsewhere. Many movie stars, authors, politicians, artists, etc. have stayed at this grand hotel and I can see why!  Our room was perfect, the breakfast fabulous (the only meal we had at the hotel due to prior commitments), service impeccable and the location excellent. Highly recommend a stay here!"

The guest relations staffer Sandeepani was professional and efficient and went out of her way. The driver Jehan Ayub was great and we enjoyed our conversation with him.   The breakfast buffet was delicious and varied. The locals foods and curries tasted like home cooked food - freshly made hoppers, stringhoppers, were appreciated. The dining space is lovely, with a fresh breeze and view of the sea.  Our room was small but more than adequate, with plenty of bottled water, comfy beds, nice bathroom.

Charles D	Amazing Long Weekend Stay	"My Wife and I were over in Colombo for a friends 50th - as I had stayed at the Galle Face Hotel 25 years earlier I headed back there. It really is the best of the best. So glad we stayed there. The Staff are amazing, so very helpful. We arrived at 1am from Sydney via Singapore. On arrival - smiles and a welcome drink (soft). We upgraded to a Premier room with Ocean View - definitely worth it. This also gives you the option to join the hotel's happy hour in the Travellers Bar between 17.30 and 19.00 - where you can order from a selection of drinks and refreshments (inc in the room). This is a perfect setting for the old Sundowners. The facilities are good - Fantastic Pool by the ocean open from 7am to 7pm, The Croquet Lawn if you fancy it, THe Gym and Spa also available."

It is such a charming, beautiful building with a stunning position on the water’s edge. We enjoyed ocean views from our well appointed room. The buffet breakfast in the verandah restaurant was a calm and atmospheric start to the day. What really elevates this hotel experience, however, is the exceptional service and outstanding staff. They look after you with genuine care and their pride in the Galle Face and its history is inspiring. Make sure that you partake in the hotel tour with the historian and watch the piping of the flag ceremony at sunset. Both are real highlights!

The rooms are spacious, the bathrooms fully equipped and roomy and the staff are just wonderful.  Special thanks to Keeth for pointing me in the right direction more than once!  They also have a salt water pool - the next best thing to swimming in the ocean (not that you would - it's pretty rough).

A couple of small issues were fixed straight away.  We had a lovely view of the crashing waves from our bedroom. Dinner buffet was limited as it was purely seafood but that was OK for me but my daughter struggled.  Breakfast also limited and not as much choice as other hotels.	Date of stay: July 2019

They are really proud of their heritage, and there’s even a small museum with pictures of some of the celebrities that have stayed here over the years.   We stayed here for two nights at the end of our Sri Lanka trip. Our room was large and equipped with an excellent shower. Breakfast, drinks and food were good and the staff very nice. Very helpful when I, late at night, realised I had forgotten my hat and glasses in the restaurant. The hotel was quiet when we were there (only a couple of months after the Easter attacks, so they scanned everyone and everything before entering the hotel). They had a 25% off all food and beverages promo running, which of course made everything even better value. Great pool."	Date of stay: July 2019

Mike Clapham	Galle Face Hotel Museum	"Largely ignored by visitors, this historic hotel has a very small museum. We had to ask how to get there. It's in the Residence Wing on the 1st Floor. Unattended but spotlessly clean, it has some old crockery and other dining items on display. Also displayed are pictures and details of famous guests that have stayed here. And what an impressive bunch they are.  But the star attraction is an old motor car, a 1935 Standard 8, said to be the first car ever owned by Prince Phillip, the Duke of Edinburgh. While stationed in Ceylon, during WWII, he bought it second hand in 1940 for Stg 12 for a trip to Trincomalee. It has been lovingly restored and is in beautiful condition. We wondered how they got it up the stairs."	Date of stay: July 2019

We have called the hotel and asked if they could send us a taxi to transport us to the hotel (which obviously we would pay for) they told us they can’t as their transportation service isn’t running as well due to the terrorist attacks.

It was such a surprise and a really lovely touch - such a brilliant place to stay.

cantravnut	loved this historic hotel	"It's rare to be at a ""city"" hotel with a pool overlooking the ocean and a bar on the beach where you can enjoy the sunset, yet be able to walk to most attractions of interest.  And the next-door Galle Green is a popular public park where it is fun to stroll at sunset with local families.  Top that off with a 150 year old history, it's own museum, a brand-new renovation and beautiful spa, and you have one of my favourite hotels of a 4 week trip.  Service and breakfast were great and it has fun quirky touches (the slingshot guy who chases away crows, the guy who shimmies up the palm trees to trim them; the bagpiper at sunset).  Recommend the higher priced rooms with balcony and view which come with access to the Long Bar and free Happy Hour drinks and snacks.  Only downside"	Date of stay: March 2019

Unfortunately, despite this, the hotel could find no record of this and after spending more than 2 hours at reception, did not provide us with the room we booked.  Exhausted, we were left with no option but to leave with nowhere to stay having just arrived in the country.

Charlie T	Timeless elegance	We stayed for a couple of nights here and loved it. It has so much charm and character compared to the newer hotel chains. The building is beautiful and the location is surely the best in colombo.  The staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was amazing with so much choice.  Would love to go back someday.

Sally M	A lovely colonial hotel	A nice few days to relax and treat ourselves between travelling to the more remote parts of Sri Lanka. A beautiful traditional Sri Lankan colonial hotel with lots of history. Good service as you would expect and the buffet dinner was plentiful and tasty .	Date of stay: April 2019
Dashiell L	"Unique, Fun, Hectic"	"We went as a family of four to the Galle Face Hotel in May. We had loads of fun. The pool was warm and sunny, and the buffet was extremely outstanding. But unfortunately, the wonderful view of the big blue Andaman sea is getting smaller as a huge complex is being built on a man-made peninsula. So, go there soon, before it is finished and the view is gone. A wonderful hotel with an enchanting vibe from the 1950s and cute, little rooms. We hope to come back one day. An amazing experience."

Hellmut Schutte	Colonial hotel in prime location	Classy service in well maintained facilities. Very different from four or five star chain hotels. History is present at any moment. Rooms differ from each other  - not surprising bearing in mind the number of renovations this hotel must have gone through.	Date of stay: March 2019

Chris ADL	enjoy the sunset in a colonial hotel	This hotel has it's own legend and a history. but it has all modern items to compete with all other hotels around the globe. my tour company highly recommended the hotel. They were right. I won't forget two things. breakfast with the breeze next to the beach and chilling out with cold beers watching sunset. really comfy rooms and food.	Date of stay: February 2019
Martin T	A great choice for Colombo	"Stayed two nights and would have been very happy to have spent longer at this very good hotel. We loved the old colonial style, the location right on the ocean front, the attractive pool area and the excellent breakfast. Ok the view from our ‘sea view’ room was mostly towards the main road but the room was lovely. We could have done with a bit more information in our room about the facilities such as restaurants (with menus would be helpful) as the building is big and we only came across the upstairs bar and restaurant when we took a wrong turning on the second floor - they both seemed deserted so maybe we weren’t the only ones to be unaware of them. There were complimentary canapés and a happy hour somewhere we were told at check-in but we didn’t come accross this and again"	Date of stay: March 2019

Suzanne H	Grand Colonial	"The Galle Face is a grand colonial building with a nice pool and outdoor area that has been renovated not far from the city. It is surrounded by other newer and big name hotels which we also stayed in, but I would definitely go back to the Galle Face if we were to return. Not all rooms are the same, some being smaller than others and not all had ocean views. Ours was 4043 which was a very large room with views of the ocean and the esplanade. Sadly the Chinese are reclaiming a lot of land from the ocean to house more buildings, so the view was somewhat marred by the cranes and trucks! The music from the esplanade which has street food can be heard in the room even with the windows closed, but it does stop at 11pm. My friends stayed in the Junior Suite and said it was fantastic"	Date of stay: March 2019

Martin	"Great colonial style hotel with the grandeur, and creaks, of its age"	"Stayed  2 nights in November 2018. First room offered had someone else's balcony outside our window so we're moved to a corner room. Lovely wooden floors and old furniture, large room and lots of shared areas in hotel. Could hear upstairs neighbours as floors all wood. Pool and gardens lovely. Some lounges seemed to be only for club guests but weren't labelled as such, so just sat there anyway and staff seekers bit uncomfortable but did nothing!"	Date of stay: November 2018
Don G	Lovely old hotel but bring your Credit card!	"Great location lots of history but those place is expensive! I loved the cocktail hour on the second floor. The was only for those staying in a suite so a lot fewer people to contend with, local munchies and decent red wine made it worth the money. But how many times are you in Galle? may as well enjoy a great hotel."	Date of stay: April 2018
Phillip Owen	Wonderful welcome and assistance from Nadeesha at Reception	"Good first impresions always count for a happy stay at any hotel,and Nadeesha at reception at the Galle Face Hotel was extremely helpful in helping us with complex flight arrangements back to London via Chennai as well as assisting with a late check out on the 11th.Both her and her colleague were supportive with that wonderful kind Singalese manner."

RachaelALoomes	This hotel oozes character	"This hotel is not cheap but it's worth every cent to stay here.  The hotel itself is a little tired but oozes character.  There is a great swimming pool area, the service is brilliant, and the location we loved.  We stayed in a junior suite (2020 which seemed bigger than the others) which gives you access to the club all day for coffee/tea and then aperitf at 5.30.  This is not to be missed.  The breakfast was included and was excellent."	Date of stay: March 2019
shakirayork	An amazing building.  And service	Alas couldn’t afford to stay.  But went numerous times whilst in Colombo.  For coffee on the breathtaking verandah.  For the amazing buffet breakfast. And for their Vivien Leigh cocktail.  Service is superb. Staff too.  The bar has photographs of who has stayed there. A British Literary who’s who.  And also the divine Viv.  It’s charm and beauty are addictive. The skill and friendliness of the staff second to none.  A trip back in time indeed. A wonderful gentle experience.	Date of stay: February 2019

The rooms was perfect, we went down to the lawn area for a beer just in time to watch the flag lowering at sunset accompanied by a bagpiper. We had a dinner in the hotel and enjoyed a wonderful curry and rice with lots of choice . Breakfast was also excellent , we then departed for our trip round Sri Lanka and returned for our last night .Very nice oceanfront room another excellent breakfast. O very good venue to start and finish our holiday ."	Date of stay: March 2019

mendip_7	Grand old lady but not to be trusted with your credit card	"We stayed here for 2 days at the end of a tour. The room was booked and paid for through our travel company. Check in was not as smooth as in our other hotels, where we were seated in a quiet area and given drinks. Here, we were left standing and service was haphazard, with some of our group of 6 being missed out of the drinks initially and not everyone being offered a sweet. The public spaces are impressive, there are lounges, a library, a museum as well as several bars. The colonial feel is impressive, down to the unformed crow scarer. We were pleased to have a sea view room, but it was quite small with the en suite taking up a disproportionate amount of room. We found it hard to get cool enough, as there was too much bedding and the air conditioning not very effective."	Date of stay: February 2019
Graham R	"Splendid hotel, splendid setting and excellent staff."	"Grand, historic hotel completely refurbished. Reception team excellent. We booked direct and had a Premier Ocean View Balcony Room 3079 (excellent); and we enjoyed the Terrace and Travellers' Restaurants for lunch and dinner over 3 nights. All staff most courteous (including Keeth, our room manager). Swimming pool, sun loungers, pool bar and Galle Green for promenading. A very enjoyable stay!"	Date of stay: March 2019
Stephen B	"Heritage, elegance, stylr"	This was the first hotel on our tour of Sri Lanka and it created a good first impression.  There is history here in this elegant building. Great atmosphere in an excellent setting by the sea.  Breakfast was served on the terrace overlooking the water. After breakfast we walked down to the water's edge to admire the view.  One surprise was to find a uniformed security guard with a slingshot who was keeping the crows and squirrels away from the patrons. I've never seen this before and probably never will see it again.  It's a pity that the lighting in the rooms wasn't better. Then again a lot of hotels all over the world seem to do this. Maybe it's mood lighting but I like to be able to see what I'm doing.

SM88	Majestic	"We had the most wonderful stay at this hotel, unfortunately it was for one night only but we thoroughly enjoyed every moment. Upon check in we were delighted we had been upgraded. Our room was beautiful - large, airy and had a separate lounge area. We had not one but two plasma screens! Breakfast included a large array of buffet items so to keep everyone satisfied. The breakfast view were dreamy! The only negative we experienced is that there was a very noisy wedding reception which was causing our walls to vibrate, thankfully the music stopped by 11/11:30 pm!"

You can feel the history of yesteryears in every corner of the grand old building.   Excellent meals, no matter what time it is. And, great coffee too, one of the few places we managed to get a real coffee.    Take a stroll along the Galle Face Promenade, just the way the Brits been doing for the past 200-300 years. And, enjoy the stunning sunsets."	Date of stay: December 2018

Uzzy1959	Comfortable but needs attention	"Stayed two nights at the start of our Sri Lanka trip. We were met by our driver Neil who would drive us throughout our holiday( this is the norm here and very affordable). We arrived in the early hours ,exhausted and wanting immediate sleep. We were given an early check in but had to pay extra.  The hotel I believe is one of the oldest in the world. It has a charm that only history can deliver. However the rooms are dark  and very basic but not at a basic price.  The pool is a big let down. A rectangular box surrounded by beds, no natural shade and insufficient parasols. Many of the parasols are broken. The toilets dingy and ‘feel ‘ unclean. The whole area looks very sad and tired.  Would I stay again,not unless it has a complete refurb. I would highly recommend cocktails /"	Date of stay: February 2019

The timber features and furniture and decor are glorious and our room facilities were all very modern and we felt spoilt.  The front staff excellent.  The cleaning staff were wonderful. The wait staff were generally all very smiling and helpful.  It was quite amusing to watch the bird scarer at breakfast.  He had a slingshot to hold up to scare the crows off the furniture.  Someone was being employed I guess and it kept the outdoor furniture clean.  The hotel faces the ocean but swimming is discouraged, but there is a pool for those inclined.  Our only negative which was remedied immediately the next morning was that the room we had the first night faced the"	Date of stay: March 2019
Elisa W	Lovely hotel but over priced	"Old colonial world charm, lovely room and hotel ammenities but actually over priced for what you receive and they nickle and dime you at every opportunity. We stayed here our first night in Sri Lanka after an a 36 hour flight from Canada. We arrived on Christmas eve at the hotel around 7 am in the morning which was fine as we were able to have breakfast and hang out by the pool and sleep which was great. Overall the hotel restaurants and bars were good but what I didnt like is that our second morning because we were jet lagged we didnt get up until mid afternoon missing our breakfast which we paid for in advance. When we were checking out the following day they had charged us for 3 morning breakfasts and I mentioned to them that we had only had 2 morning breakasts. They verified"	Date of stay: December 2018
SPH90	Lovely	"My husband and I stayed at the GFH for one night; our first night in Sri Lanka before heading to Tangalle. We arrived just at the right time to watch the sunset from our bedroom, stunning. Although the bed was only a double (used to a bigger bed) the bed sheets were amazing!  One stand out person for us was the concierge, Emmanuelle. Even though he was due to go off duty, he helped us to secure the train tickets we needed for our 7am journey the following morning. Above and beyond, thank you so much.   We definitely wished we could have stayed longer than one night and would definitely come back."	Date of stay: February 2019
Jayanta F (K'suriya)	"Beautiful rooms, lousy staff"	"The GFH is one of the oldest hotels in Colombo, and catered to the Colonial types ( ""'no natives please""), who patronized it in days gone by .Unfortunately it still retains the decrepit waiters who have long past their ""used by "" dates. I and a friend visited the GFH (albeit more than a year ago - but the memory lingers) - where we waited 30 minutes before anyone would condescend to take our order."	Date of stay: April 2018
Anna H	Grand hotel with lovely common area but small older rooms that are noisy	"If you like old grand hotels, this is one of them. The pool is salt water and large enough. Very pretty common areas and large reception rooms where weddings and banquets are held. As an overnight guest, however, the rooms were small and older (updated with limitations) and the sound comes through as ours had a connecting door (one door only) and our neighbor was conducting business loudly on the phone right next to the door.  They had an early morning wake up call and we can hear the alarm. We were told we were upgraded to a room with a sea view but that did not make up for the noise factor. The bed was a double and we are used to a king size. Pool sleep quality. The breakfast and dinner were buffet style and was fine. birds can snatch your food but they have someone with a"	Date of stay: February 2019

This place is full of history and so well maintained for over 100 years, it's unbelievable. Harrison Ford dined and stayed amongst all the other film stars, presidents and musicians. The breakfast speed is divine with a choice of juices from heaven and even king coconut water filled and chilled in jugs. Pancakes, hoppers, idly, waffles, porridge, fruit (including rose apple when in season) and gluten free raspberry muffins. Please can I have breakfast forever!!!!"	Date of stay: March 2019

The breakfast buffet was extensive, well presented and of a very high standard. Probably the best feature of the hotel are the people who work there, absolutely wonderful!! they were extremely helpful and welcoming. nothing was too much trouble. for example we received a message from one of the other hotels on our itinerary was having difficulty with our booking, The concierge (Emmanuelle) made several calls on our behalf and sorted the problem out for us. This was something I didn't expect but it was very much appreciated. Overall we were disappointed to leave the hotel and wished we had been able to stay a few more days."	Date of stay: February 2019

We had a Landmark Queen Room which was nicely furnished and clean with a comfortable bed and well appointed bathroom. The only thing missing was a balcony, although we did enjoy a sea view. Everything about the hotel oozes class, from the flower arrangements in reception to murals and artwork, and furniture dotted around the common areas - it's all exceptional. We found the quality and choice of food for either breakfast or buffet dinner excellent, and although we were only booked in on a B&B basis we ate dinner here twice as we thought the price was most reasonable.

Service was generally good and only let down by slow service in the bars. The food was excellent in the buffet, and we also enjoyed the King of the Mambo restaurant. Rooms are very nice, and the sea water pool a bonus. Prices for drinks and food were very reasonable considering the surroundings"	Date of stay: February 2019
Pontinha2015	Most helpful staff ever!!!	I didn’t stayed at this hotel but I had to write a review about their helpful staff. Since my arrival all the staff was extremely helpful and courteous. I needed to contact someone by phone and Mrs Yvone from the reception desk was spectacular!! She not only called my tour company but made sure my driver was outside before I got there. Many hotels would not considering help someone that is not a guest but this one it was an exception. I definitely would stay here when I come back to Colombo.	Date of stay: February 2019

The room had ac and a ceiling fan The buffet dinner and breakfast were great and there was a free happy hour 5.30- 7.00 The pool was huge although very salty n they had a reasonable gym, steam room, sauna ,spa as well as extensive massage therapy rooms.I could easily live there and cant wait to go back!"

JanHolstebro	Shape up	"This legendary hotel has it all: History, location, impressing decor, great food, a 30 m swimming pool and a beautiful sea view. But it also has slow and absent service at breakfast - had to ask for coffee three times to mention one example - and loud music throughout all of the hotel until 11.30pm.

This is an historic building and is beautifully maintained. This is a must if you are staying in Colombo and are prepared to spend a totally fair but highish rate for accommodation. The food is first rate and there is a great deal of choice from Buffet to a la carte and eating round the pool or in the ""with it"" bar above the beach. It is extremely well managed and all the staff are first rate. Nothing is too much trouble which is as it should be.

There are many new stylish hotels in the Galle Face Green area of Colombo but I would always choose to return to this one. It has an atmosphere of colonial grandeur and is steeped in history which none of the new hotels can match. It is situated right on the ocean side and one can watch absolutely spectacular sunsets from the pool bar and gardens on the coastal side and eat dinner listening to the sound of the waves unfolding on to the shore. It is truly magical at sunset and after dark. Service at the Galle Face is truly excellent. The professional staff take great care of their customers and resolve every need.

We had specifically asked for a sea view room, and to be fair, we could see the sea from the side window. It wasn’t until we came to get to sleep that we found that the room was on the front corner overlooking a busy and noisy roundabout ! Although the management offered to change the room for  us for the second night, it didn’t seem worth the inconvenience just for one night. It was just a shame that we weren’t put into a proper sea view room which overlooked the beach.

Peter N	Great hotel - main restaurant a bit chaotic	"This is a great place to stay in Colombo, it’s on the ocean but within easy reach of the city centre by tuktuk, and it’s good for a stroll around Galle Green.  We had a room with ocean view - well worth booking this.   Service was very good, pool a decent size but difficult to find shade at some times during the day so we retired to the adjacent pool bar for beers and snacks!  The main Veranda Restaurant is good, and has a great view, but was really busy and a bit chaotic when we were there for dinner; they focus on their buffet but will do a la carte if you are sufficiently insistent!  If we return to Colombo we will return to the Galle Face."	Date of stay: February 2019

ROBRTW	So glad we opted for this Colonial Gem rather than an international chain hotel	"I hate to say while traveling the less developed world, there's a certain sense of ""safety"" in staying with a chain hotel, but there are times when throwing caution to the wind pays off.   We had a forced overnight in Colombo (OK, I forced it so we could get a taste of Sri Lanka) - and it turned out to be a great choice.   The Galle Face is a crown jewel for those who can appreciate a sense of history that survives to this day.   The beautifully appointed lobby had the glorious feeling of a bygone era of luxury travel, which still feeling crisply modern.

Needs more sun umbrellas around the pool.  Could do with another 6 - 8.  And groan.....when will big hotels stop using plastic straws?  Must use hundreds and hundreds in a single day.  Use paper or just don't.    The usual request to 'save the planet' by not needing towels washed every day is a bit hackneyed and old hat.  I wanted to see a strong sustainability statement from this hotel which has been in Sri Lanka for many years."	Date of stay: February 2019

I liked the bathroom especially,quite big and bright and very useful for ladies. Also I liked the way they separate the toilet.  My room was immaculate with ocean views. The hotel was originally built by four British entrepreneurs in 1864, you need at least a half day to explore the hotel remarkable history displayed in the library.   I was impressed by all of staff with their professionalism and they are very helpful and extremely friendly.   Morning buffet is amazing with the variety and quality, great way to start the morning. I will be certaily staying here again definitely."	Date of stay: December 2018

Negative part was breakfast. To crowded, below average food. Free breakfast, but still had to pay for bottled water?"	Date of stay: February 2019
Alice A	Beautiful Hotel	"Fab time at the Galle Face Hotel - a real touch of luxury. Would recommend it as a place to stay either just after flying into Colombo airport or the night(s) preceding your departure (this is more due to Colombo being quite small rather than the hotel quality).   Hotel is nicely decorated and the small museum is a great touch. Breakfast is excellent and the views from the restaurant and pool are awesome.   Drinks and food are quite pricey for Sri Lanka and speed of service can be quite relaxed - but the quality is good and it adds to the relaxed environment.   Reception team are very accommodating, warm and friendly, and were helpful with some driver issues we had after checkout."	Date of stay: February 2019

We particularly liked having lunch at the Traveler's Bar and drinks at the pool bar with beautiful views of an ocean storm and sunset. The hotel is steeped in history and feels simply grand. My critiques of the hotel are that none of the restaurants offer Sri Lankan cuisine (with the exception of the usual rice and curry) and the traffic noise from the main road. We decided to eat dinner elsewhere so that we could have more Sri Lankan choices. The western food served at the hotel and breakfast dishes were quite good though.	Date of stay: February 2019

AlakGRaju	'Colonial Charm'	"One of those old world hotels, where the Royalty and Important guest have stayed over the past 150 years or so, renovated over the years, wooden staircases etc, lot's of facilities including restaurants overlooking the Indian Ocean, late night music on the ocean front etc"	Date of stay: January 2019
jaguar1954	2nights before travelling up country	"Great seafront location retaining all the old colonial features.  Service and food excellent.  Rooms were meant to be superior but we had a view of the car park and railway line. Hate to see an ordinary standard room!!  Beware the hotel taxi at least three to four times the cost of local taxi and billed to your room. We did not know so taxi driver , who stood waiting payment before getting our bags out , got  a eking tip at out expense."	Date of stay: February 2019
FRANCIS F	OLD CHARM HOTEL	we spent one night recently and it was a great experience.This is a historic property and hence one has to put up with small room space etc without being too ticked off.  the highlight for us was having breakfast at the patio overlooking the Indian ocean and this was priceless ! The spread at the buffet was good but the juices were watery.Try to walk on the park and see all the vendors with exotic food items etc and the morning sea breeze is uplifting.  it is pricey but woth the experience !

Sundip S	Mediocre stay	Arrived at the hotel at 3pm. Was checked in at reception by a young man learning his job. Check in was relatively easy at the reception  desk. It was not in a separate seated area like the other three hotels we stayed in during our trip to beautiful Sri Lanka. However we were upgraded to a suite with a poor view of some rooftops. The same man showed us to our room but did not explain any of the room amenities to us. The room was large with a small separate seating area. The en-suite has awkward step up to enter. The room was extremely dimly lit. The lighting was insufficient and there was virtually no daylight in the bedroom. My wife found it very hard to read anything. The en-suite was the same and I cut myself shaving as a result. My wife did complain but was told that	Date of stay: February 2019
Tim M	Our first taste of sri Lanka	A lovely hotel that made a perfect first impression after a long flight. Rooms were a little dated but the poolside and bar were lovely - with ocean lapping alongside. Staff were very friendly and breakfast delicious.

My Tropical Journal	Colonial Icon in Heart of Colombo	"Once a British entrepreneurial hub, history of this iconic monument dated back 1864. Being one of the oldest hotel in Asia, still owns that early prestige.   Lunch buffet had a nice spread and was awesome. Little pastry shop have savories and sweets for a quick snack bite.  Memorise of the colonial era dispersed every corner of the building and have a library with handy collection of books.  Little sea water pool is a must try.  The magnificent night view of the Indian ocean is a great stress releaser amidst of busy Colombo."	Date of stay: November 2018

bgrant722	Grandeur at its best	Cocktail on the lawn and watch them pipe down the flag at sunset is a must in Colombo. walk through the hotel and check out the old photos in the bar is a walk back in history. the cocktails are superb and the staff very attentive.	Date of stay: February 2019
Lisa	Lovely Old Hotel	"This is a beautiful old building which is located on the seafront in Colombo. The service from the staff was very good and they were only too pleased to help. Food was plentiful and lots of choice. Curries varied and spicy. The restaurant is lovely and gives an air of good times past. Room was large, clean and had the most wonderful wooden floor. All in all an excellent choice for our first night in Sri Lanka."	Date of stay: February 2019
Patricia	Wonderful Service	"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights from 12 January, but unfortunately was taken ill and had to remain in my room for the following 2 days.  The lobby Manager, Mr Rakitha Amerasinghe was incredible.  His kindness and help was immeasurable and I cannot thank him enough for all he did for me - from arranging my medication to be purchased and brought to me as well as checking to make sure I was ok.  The original room I was give 3030, overlooked rooftops, so not the best view, but was moved to one overlooking the sea which was wonderful.  The reception staff were all very helpful, but the one person that The Galle Face Hotel should be really proud to have as a member of staff is Mr Amerasinghe.  Thank you for your caring."

paul803	Fine hotel at a great location	"Located just between the ‘fort’ and the Indian Ocean, Galle Face hotel Colombo offers good rooms with good facilities, great swimming pool at the seaside, friendly and hospitable staff and a great spa. Good value for money!"	Date of stay: February 2019
colin49uk	Wonderful grand hotel	"We stayed here 3 years ago and just had to come back. It's as splendid as ever.  Great service, comfortable rooms, great food. What more can I say. We had a corner room overlooking the sea and Galle face Green so that gave s great views. This was a Premium room but well worth the extra.(this is of course not a cheap place to stay.) I know its all a bit anachronistic but its great fun and a good base for exploring Colombo."	Date of stay: January 2019

Lak_Sur	Extremely a different feeling !!!	"Galle Face Hotel is one of the oldest colonial hotels in Asia. I stayed there over night and I was amazed with their architecture, service and all other facilities. They have maintained the colonial look of it as it is while making the stay so luxury."

MattandStev	The rooms are all different.	"I loved the Galle Face Hotel. Its a beautiful heritage property and every part of the hotel boasts of luxury and old world charm.   My room 1230 was big and spacious. The rooms are all different, I would recommend going for an ocean view more because the non-ocean views are closer to the busy Galle Face Road and the whole hotel is low rise so noise is more of an issue.  In saying that, the location is wonderful, right by the sea and it feels wonderful to have your food while sitting by the sea side."	Date of stay: January 2019
Venture5414	Favorite hotel in Sri Lanka	"Beautiful hotel steeped in history, as documented in the very interesting small museum within the hotel.    Many novels that have been written about Sri Lanka mention characters staying at this hotel.    The staff is very attentive.   Chief Concierge Emmanuel was especially helpful; after I unintentionally left a personal item at a hotel in another city in Sri Lanka, he coordinated the return of the item to the Galle Face Hotel and kept it safe until friends could retrieve it at a later date.     Try for a room overlooking the Indian Ocean and you will have a front row seat to beautiful sunsets, bustling activity around the large swimming pool and outdoor restaurant, and you may even see weddings taking place on the lovely grounds.    Access to the Long Room for afternoon drinks"	Date of stay: December 2018
GRPOxford_England	Colombo icon which does not disappoint	This is a superb hotel with a unique history and outstanding position on Colombo's waterfront. The service is excellent and the quality of meals and drinks was very good indeed. Each night in the main restaurant was themed so that in addition to an excellent range of Sri Lankan dishes there was an alternative such as Thai with lots of choice. Drinks and canapes in the Long Room were very good although one of the days we were there was a public holiday on which no alcohol could be served. Our room had  a premier ocean view and looked over the water on two sides and excellent views over the Galle Face green It was extremely comfortable and spacious. The hotel boasts a very agreeable (large) salt water swimming pool which was inevitably very popular. The hotel is large but manages	Date of stay: January 2019
SurreyConnie	Beautiful restored historic building	"So pleased to have eventually stayed at this historic hotel.  When we travelled to Colombo before the hotel was closed for renovation.   We had a beautiful room on the corner so facing the sea and the Galle Face.  Unfortunately beneath us was the newly opened Bamba bar which plays very loud music until 2am.  We tried to move rooms but were told the hotel was full.  This was the only thing that spoilt our stay, the staff are so attentive, food excellent, however if you don’t get a good night’s sleep and are paying a lot of money for that room it would be better to stay overnight somewhere else and visit for afternoon tea or dinner.  The whole ambience of the hotel has been totally spoilt by introducing this bar, which seems to be more popular with locals rather than hotel"	Date of stay: January 2019
Lyndallaussie	Wonderful historic hotel with perfect views	"The Galle Face Hotel is a very big hotel with a lot of wonderful history. We had a fantastic room with a balcony overlooking the sea and the pool. It has recently been renovated and there is a very interesting museum and a large buffet dining area, verandah bar and a fine dining restaurant, plus a poolside bar and snack area. The staff on the front door and the desk were most helpful and polite.   We were disappointed with the buffet dinner, not something I would normally choose but the fine dining lacked atmosphere.  The area is quite lovely and colonial with ceiling fans whirring. I felt the staff too were disinterested in serving and were quite rude. On the other hand the staff at the pool bar were terrific and efficient.   The pool is quite large but is deep - slightly"	Date of stay: January 2019
Jane	The perfect place to relax after our flight.	"A proper ""grand"" hotel with excellent service and comfort.

We had the delightful Ivoni Samanmali, Guest Relation Executive who went out of her way to please us in all our needs. Also Emanuel the concierge was a very gentle kind and helpful man who greeted us every day concerned of our every need. We would definitely go back. The hotel has a lot of character with many different areas to enjoy throughout the day besides it also being situated on the beach so many rooms have ocean views which is very welcoming. The food served for breakfast was awesome, plus this brought back many memories for us going back to 50 years when we were young. So, all in all it was magical, delightful and inspiring there are good gentle people still around."	Date of stay: January 2019
Nipuni F	Exceptional service! Beautiful venue!	"We had our wedding reception at Galle Face hotel on 26th January 2016 and they did an outstanding job at helping us cordinate the event. Everything from the food, the wait staff, rooms provided and the overall service was excellent. Special mention should be made of Mr Ujitha Peiris, Manager-Security and his staff who did an outstanding job of arranging and cordinating security for the event. He went out of his way to ensure that the event went ahead as smoothly as possible and handled the everything with extreme professionalism and attention. Banquet manager Mr Tuan and our coordinator Nimanthi were both very helpful too. We are extremely glad to have picked Galle Face for our wedding and would gladly recommend it to everyone we know. Thank you for everything."	Date of stay: January 2019
Elise J	Top quality hotel well worth the money	It is not cheap but it is such a treat. We booked this because we knew we would have been travelling for 21 hours and wanted to be confident of a good hotel. We were not disappointed. We arrived in the morning and there was a room available. It was spacious and the bed large and sumptuous. We spent the afternoon by the pool. Plenty of shade available although being typically British we wanted to be in the sun. As you sit by the pool you are relaxed by the sound of the waves from the sea hitting the rocks. The views over the beach beautiful. We had drinks and food which were reasonable price. Outside of the hotel is the green where locals come to play cricket or do their exercises which was fascinating to watch. There is a short promenade along the beach where there are local	Date of stay: January 2019

Soraya	Welcome to Sri Lanka	"My husband and I stayed here for two nights when we first arrived in Sri Lanka. The hotel was everything we hoped it would be - old world charm amidst the busy and bustling Colombo city. The room was understated and classically designed. We didn’t fancy any of the modern Colombo hotels. There is a new bar and restaurant area called King of the Mambo which does lovely cocktails and food right by the ocean. The pool is large and you can properly swim in it. Very refreshing after a hot and muggy day. The sunset views were fantastic. Breakfast on the verandah was beautiful. Amazing selection of food, friendly staff and beautiful atmosphere."	Date of stay: January 2019

paul h	Moved out.	Great location but an old style colonial setting was not to my liking. Wooden floors and thin walls mean you can hear everything in the rooms. Poor buffet breakfast.... If you asked for any of the deli meats from your waiter you would get 1 slice. Asking for porridge would take 20 mins+.  Buffet generally poor all day at any meal time. Travellers bar the same along with the pool bar food. The mambo bar thou was great and really nice food.  I was checked into the hotel for 40 nights but moved after 6....cinnamon far better	Date of stay: January 2019

Tim M	"Lovely location, nice hotel, great history and loved the pool"	"Positives Great food, good service, lovely historical feel of the hotel. Pool and location are the reason you stay at this hotel!  Negative experience:  We had a very annoying check-in at 1am in the morning - the room not ready and had to wait until 2am - despite calling twice to let them know we would arrive after midnight - however, manager apologized next day and provided free buffet lunch (but not drinks).  I appreciate the apology - however, the 1am experience highlights areas for improvement in staff training and process"	Date of stay: December 2018
Terry and Paule	Galle Face Old World Charm	"Very comfortable, personable service in a delightful old colonial British hotel circa 1864.  The service was exceptionally friendly, courteous and welcoming.  The customer service was warm and genuine.  The food was of 5 star hotel quality, with great variety, fresh and inviting, superb rice and curry as well as international cuisine.  The Long Room, Tavellers's Lodge and Verandah Bar all with spectacular views of the Indian Ocean. Special thanks to the Hotel Doctor Galappathi and the nurse Mr Weerappulige who provided excellent medical attention to me after a fall. Also, to Chaya for her historic tour, organisation of transport and other tours. Finally, to all housekeeping and restaurant staff who made our stay very memorable - thank you."

Cakeangel	Luxurious hotel	"We stayed for 2 nights at the start of our visit to Sri Lanka, it was an excellent way to relax after a long flight. The hotel is spotlessly clean, the staff are pleasant, helpful and friendly. We were upgraded to a large, comfortable suite on arrival. Breakfast buffet was excellent, we ate out in the evening so I cannot comment on the evening meals. My only negatives are that drinks were rather pricey, and bizarrely there were no hooks in our room to hang dressing gowns or towels on!"	Date of stay: January 2019
Michael B	Old World surrounded by new world high rise	"The moment you check-in you realise you are in a place which echoes the past. It sells itself on its grand heritage and numerous eminent celebrity guests and politicians who have favoured this place above others.  The helpful staff help to ensure a relaxing stay, with good eating options and a first class sea water swimming pool that is hardly used. If you are a swimmer, this will make your stay. The little gym and spa area is Good for staying in shape, while trying to limit the calories. A little bonus is that the contents of the non-alcoholic mini bar are complimentary.  Some of the facilities may need to be updated, but the food quality and value is excellent"	Date of stay: January 2019
orders2016	Helpful staff!!! Amazing staff!!! Stay here.	"We stayed at the Galle Face Hotel while entering and then exiting Sri Lanka. Amazing does not adequately describe the service and facilities at the hotel. Having made an error about our arrival on New Years Eve, the night staff found us a room, in a fully booked hotel, at 2 AM. We were so thankful.  On our second stay, the staff recalled our names, drink preferences and were beyond helpful. The rooms were spotless, the food was great and the security guard with the slingshot rustling birds away from the dinning area was spectacular.    What a fantastic hotel. We highly recommend it."

ppllikeme	Amazing food	Gave us a free upgrade for our two nights. Very spacious and clean room. Free buffet breakfast that served the best Sri Lankan food I’ve ever had (they also have many many western choices). They also offer buffet dinner for reasonable price which was also amazing. Only fault is that drinks prices were on he high end.	Date of stay: January 2019
happytravellerwoman1	Excellent stay for the end of our holidays	"We had a wonderful stay in this hotel! we paid a bit more to be upgraded to a room with a balcony. Unfortunately the balcony faced to the side (see view but as well street view) and it was a bit too noisy for us. We talked to the reception and got another free upgrade to the other side of the hotel (older part). The room was superb, very large and it had a beautiful bathroom, it was also very quiet. I also had a facial treatment in the spa which was amazing and very professional. The breakfast buffet is very good but would have expected better coffee, the one we got was not very good with too much water. Overall, a super nice colonnial style hotel, would definitely come again."	Date of stay: January 2019

jfn20	"Beautiful hotel, but rooms need an update."	"Staying at the Galle Face Hotel was one of the highlights of our trip to Sri Lanka. It is a very charming place and has loads more character than a non-descript modern 5 star hotel. We very much enjoyed the pool area and the service was always impeccable. The location is excellent and the sunsets are unforgettable.  However, we found that our room was in need of update. Although we were provided with a very large room that comfortably accommodated 2 adults and 2 children, in a hotel of this category (and price) you would not expect to have windows that need cleaning, loose floorboards, and a squeaky mattress/bed. On the positive side, AC and WiFi worked very well and the bathroom was gorgeous."	Date of stay: January 2019

On arrival we were greeted by friendly hospitable staff which was continued by all staff throughout the hotel. Because we were on Honeymoon, we were upgraded to a huge room with a four poster bed, massive bathtub and a huge sun terrace overlooking the pool & sea where we enjoyed the complimentary champagne whilst we rested after our long flight. There was also a free minibar with soft drinks and snacks for us to enjoy, along with the additional Honeymoon cake and fruit platter.

SleeplessinSD	Top of the line	"The Galle Face Hotel was built when the American Civil War was still raging. Today it still commands what surely must be the best location in Colombo, and it looks better than it must have looked when it was new. It’s been enlarged into ever grander proportions over all the years, while hosting heads of state, movie and sports stars, authors, adventurers, and other celebrities. It looks immaculate, and the staff achieves the highest levels of solicitous service.  On a recent two-night stay there, we had the opportunity to see the staff deal with a difficult situation. We’d booked and prepaid our room through an online vendor (HotelQuickly), and we were horrified to learn that our reservation had been cancelled without any notice to us or refund of what we paid.

Abby B	"I'm a sucker for colonial architecture; dark wood, sweeping staircases, and history."	"Spent two nights -- the first and last nights of our tour -- with a group. Nice location on the beach, beautiful old building, reasonably comfortable.   If you are mobility challenged, or just don't like walking a lot, ask for a room on the second or third floor. As the hotel was built over a period of time, it's one of those ""you can't get there from here"" type of things. There is a direct elevator to the fourth floor from the rear restaurant lobby. But from Reception, the elevator only goes to the third floor...  A beautiful location for weddings, we were assailed with a lot of music and wedding noise our second night which interfered with our sleep. If you've got an early flight, ask for your breakfast to go. (We didn't know to do that.)"	Date of stay: December 2018
Chris Q	High expectation but dissapointed	"Beautiful location , lovely building , great verandah dining and fine dining restaurants and travellers bar . Building loaded with history .

You can’t help but soak in the history of this lovely hotel and there is even a small museum on the second floor which also contains a car that belonged to Prince Philip when he was stationed in Ceylon during World War 2. There are a number of restaurants to choose from - we chose to relax by the pool with a variety of snacks and appetisers as well as some delicious cocktails, so that we could enjoy the sunset and the flag lowering ceremony.

Someoneinsydney	"Lovely, comfortable historic hotel"	"Lovely historic hotel. Travelled with 3 kids aged 21 months, 5 and 7. Had a large room with a sunroom separated by French doors which was perfect set up for us giving adults some privacy. Rooms were clean and well equipped, if slightly shabby.   Highlight was the breakfast area, lovely sea views across the lawns. Only issue was that on day two the views were interrupted by a makeshift stage built for a wedding - I remember having this same issue when we visited 12 years ago.   Pool also good although not ideal for young kids as no shallow end. But lovely position overlooking the ocean.   Service was fine - not up to south East Asian standards but no major issues.  Would definitely stay again."	Date of stay: December 2018

Unfortunately the hotel rather misses on this . We had a Junior Ocean Front Suite at almost $700 for the night and I really struggle to see this as anything resembling value in this day and age .  We were staying in the South Wing , which I believe has not been renovated yet or at least I hope it hasn’t ! The location is excellent with a great view and one of the biggest private terraces that we have ever had .

London_Gourmet	Below Par for a Luxury Hotel	"We stayed for 1 night and felt disappointed by our stay.   We love luxury hotels with a history, but felt that this one was somehow lacking grandeur. Perhaps this was due to the timing of pur stay (the busy christmas holiday period). Compared to the Taj in Mumbai or The Strand in Yangon this was a disappointment.   We arrived and had to wait for check in. Instead of being offered a cold drink, a refreshing towel and a seat, we had to stand in line and a waiter was going around with a tray of welcome drinks. This felt more package holiday than luxury.   The other guests also looked more like tour groups - no style at all. Also note that the hotel caters almost exclusively to European tourists.  There are nice colonial style touches, but especially the restaurants and dining"	Date of stay: December 2018

meandering2014	A nostalgic visit	I returned to the hotel after many years and found it to be recognisable with traditional features.  It is somewhat grander  than before but has unfortunately succumbed to the package tourist market which has dulled some of the grandeur.  There is no longer a buzz but a rather resigned and impersonal approach to the provision of service which was disappointing.  There are other more enjoyable hotel experiences to be had in  Colombo but a visit to the Galleface for a cup of tea or a drink should not be missed	Date of stay: December 2018
ArtajS	Likely oldest large Colonial Hotel in Lanka	"Grand property right at the ocean front in downtown Colombo. Open uninterrupted views of the ocean. Refurbished but maintaining its old luxury ambience and British heritage. Large rooms, very tastefully and simply done. Great service consistent with the hotel of its caliber. Excellent spa."

LengDyson	Best thing is having breakfast at the Verandah	"I made a mistake in the date of the booking but the hotel was able to accommodate us. We took 2 standard rooms. Although we did not book rooms with the sea view our rooms on the ground floor did have a side view of the sea. The rooms are rather old and could do with some upgrading. There was a musty smell symptomatic of old building which have not been aired properly. Otherwise the beds were comfortable and the room came with the usual amenities. But the best thing was having breakfast on the Verandah the next morning. The Verandah is an expansive, unenclosed restaurant that opens out to a beautiful lawn facing the sea. The breakfast buffet has a huge selection of food with local and western offerings. The view is just gorgeous. The main job of  2 gentlemen in khakis on the lawn"	Date of stay: December 2018
Graciegeorge	Colonial Hotel with lovely staff	"When booking hotels I always struggle between the wish for luxury and wanting to also experience history. This hotel booking was a result of history winning out. Our stay didn’t start well with our agent promising a certain category room but paying for a lesser one. The hotel however rectified it and despite me offering to pay for the upgrade, gave it to us complimentary. We ended up with an ocean view suite which was lovely.   The hotel breakfast is buffet and adequate with both English and Sri Lankan options. It has a great little gym and beautiful spa. The staff here however are what make the stay very pleasant.   If I was the GM of that hotel ( a game I play often!) I would rip the car park out at the front and have a grand circular driveway with gardens. The facade is so"	Date of stay: December 2018

Brian E	Historic grandeur	"When we planned to come to Sri Lanka and to finish our time in Colombo there was one place that was a must. This hotel is redolent with history and atmosphere, is located right next to Galle Green and has a direct waterfront facing the Indian Ocean. That provides the very best of sunsets.   We made sure we had booked a room with an ocean view and were happy when booking in to discover that we even had an upgrade. We had not one but two balconies and access to the Long Room for afternoon snacks and drinks and coffee at anytime of the day.  We were made to feel welcome from the very beginning and the delightful Sanju who walked us to our room could not have been more helpful.  On our first full day we completed the hotel’s historic tour and our guide, Mohamed, gave our party of"	Date of stay: December 2018
fylde_wanderer	Met expectations	"We stayed at the Galle Face Hotel for the final night of a 2 week holiday in Sri Lanka in December.  It’s a 5 star hotel, but only met my expectations given the room rate and the rating.  We were at first allocated a room overlooking Galle Road, but were immediately changed when we complained about the loud road noise on that side of the hotel. Our new room was perfectly adequate, but plain for a 5 star hotel. Having been told at reception we had a “complimentary minibar”, it was almost comical to find that included only a couple of soft drinks and some nibbles.  The hotel itself is a lovely example of colonial grandeur, but it’s rapidly being swamped by the development of mega-hotels nearby.  The breakfast buffet was fine: geared towards western tastes, but the local food we’d"	Date of stay: December 2018
Susanne W	Fantastic hotel!	"We had a beautiful room with a view of the ocean, loved the 30m saltwater pool and the choice and quality of the eating places and bars (great cocktails, too). All the staff were extremely nice and helpful, especially Nadeesha at the reception. They were very accommodating when we needed to extend our stay for a later check-out. The unique setting directly by the ocean let’s you forget the mad bustle of Colombo. I would never stay anywhere else in the city and am leaving with a heavy heart."	Date of stay: December 2018
CEG	Nice colonial hotel	"Very nice colonial hotel. Very friendly and helpfull staff. Great buffet menu for breakfast and lunch. High quality cocktails to enjoy whilst enjoying the beach and sunset. Spa facilities are also very good.   The only thing if you suffer allergies is that given that it is an older beach hotel, there was a musty smell in the suite room we stayed in. Also, the suite room would benefit from some minor upgrades to lift up the grandeur of the room.  The library, museum and restaurant are all very nice."	Date of stay: December 2018

Richard-timetogo	A wonderful stay	"Enjoying a wonderful stay in this fabulous ex colonial wonder. The who’s who of previous guests, Yuri Gagarin to Che Guevara! amongst many movie and other stars gives you a hint of a long and splendid history, which is worn lightly with excellent service.  Apparently the British accidentally shot the hotel while testing one of the canons they inherited when taking over Sri Lanka from the Dutch (colonialism 101...). Appropriately close to shooting oneself in the foot.   Breakfast curries outstanding, all five of them!"	Date of stay: December 2018

terrytrevena	Brilliant venue for sunset drinks	We only visited Colombo briefly but it was recommended by our guide to visit the Galle Face Hotel around sunset. We were fortunate as we arrived just before the cricket finished for the day so we were allocated a table for four with a wonderful view from the colonial style balcony out to the ocean. The service was excellent and the sunset spectacular. We were also treated to the lowering of the flag by military personnel. The cricket supporters arrived soon after us and provided great interchange of travel and sporting tales. A most memorable experience.	Date of stay: December 2018

The hotel can only be described as grand.  All the public rooms and spaces are high class. Excellent housekeeping provided every day by Keith.  He was also an excellent source of tourist information, providing us with lots of info on the Hotel and Colombo in general. Breakfast was a treat every morning in a smart setting overlooking the sea.  Great food and great choices.

Food and drink offerings excellent, quality very good. Breakfast was included and we used the buffet for evening meal 7 nights, expansive by colombo standards,  but food very good. Our room was fine, clean, AC and a ceiling fan. The bed was huge and very comfortable. Shower excellent. Mini bar ( no charge) is stocked with water, soft drinks and snack on daily basis.

We enjoyed the huge breakfast buffet and the food at the restaurants within the hotel, which was well prepared and reasonably priced. My room, in the old section, was a bit hostel-like with a plain white bed cover, no pillow shams, a very small framed print and little else. There was a smell of mold. More could be done to make the guest rooms in this section equal to the decor and comfort of the public spaces. I appreciated the mini-fridge with snacks and lime drinks, and the fresh fruit and cookies. Overall the team working here seems very dedicated, pleasant and professional.

Lots of nooks and crannies to explore include a museum with black & white pictures of everyone who has stayed there. Good priced cocktails available at a bar overlooking the sea soon swept away our travel fatigue. Lots of places to relax and variety of food on offer. Fantastic breakfast and a piper played to the lowering of the Sri-Lankan flag at sunset. Lovely room and thank you for my husbands birthday cake. Staff were all fantastic, lots of smiles and nice to have doors held open. My only comment would be its easy to get lost in some of the corridors."	Date of stay: November 2018
UrbanAvantGarde	"An iconic Colombo hotel overlooking the Galle Sea Face, alas living too much, and showing, its past."	"This not to be missed Colombo classic with a majestic view of the Galle Sea Face still carries the grace and memories of its hoary past. Unfortunately, that age also shows in most of the hotel; and most of the rooms that we saw, were also strangely cramped for a hotel of such vintage. Still, for a big hotel, the food and service remain very good!"	Date of stay: June 2018

It’s an iconic hotel in Colombo and has an old world charm about it, but has kept up with modern standards and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. Our room was large and airy on the side of the hotel with a sea view. Kept spotlessly clean, the linen and towels were great quality as you’d expect. We had access to The Long Room as part of our rate which was lovely in the evening for a cocktail to watch the sunset. We used the buffet breakfast which had everything you could want and more, and also used it for an evening buffet - a great way to try different local food and curry.

Recommend you ask for a water front side room which may not be quite as noisy. Great breakfast buffet which covers all requirements.

"We visit this hotel whenever we want to chill out with a cocktail by the beach - I'm talking about sitting under an umbrella canopy at the pool bar, because the ambience is usually excellent, both at noon and at night.   But this our recent visit was one of the most traumatic, ever. The beauty and serenity of nature was shattered by a raucous 'cultural show'. The hotel was not concerned about shattering our ear drums either. So the evening was disappointing, to say the least. As a result, we decided to call it a day by about 9 pm. We then returned to the main entrance and submitted the parking ticket and waited and waited and waited for the car. During the first half hour we were patient.

Throughout our stay everyone greeted us with a smile and often wanted to talk to us about cricket. The room was a delight with an enormous bath in the middle of it. It was extremely comfortable and the fridge was well stocked with complimentary snacks and drinks. As soon as we had eaten these they were replenished free of charge.

I’ve given it an average given its positives but was quite close to rating as poor.   Ground floor rooms are noisy with wooden floor above and was woken up both nights. There was a party on my second night until gone 2am. I checked out a day early at 6pm as there was another event that night. The room is also quite dark, and the lights a pain to turn off.

Bob	Exceeded expectations. Beautiful colonial hotel by the sea with exceptional service.	"We would describe our stay at Galle Face Hotel as the perfect experience. It is a beautiful hotel, with courteous staff offering exceptional service. When we arrived, we had a little misunderstanding around our room, but the staff were quick to sort it out for us and offer us an upgrade as compensation for our discontent, which frankly was no fault of theirs. We would especially like to give a shout out to our Lobby Manager Mr. Dhanuka Samaraweera, who was truly helpful. Something he said when we were offered the upgrade really struck a chord with us (as a family travelling with a baby). He acknowledged how it would be difficult for us to move around and pack and unpack from one room to the other with the baby, and so why don't we take up the upgrade offer.

chris s	Colonial hotel on the Centre of Colombo	"This is a colonial style hotel and one of the originals of this type in the Far East. It is in the same mould as the Peninsular in Honk Kong or Raffles in Singapore - but less pretentious. Colombo is more laid back as a place. It is not one of those five star modern hotels which now exist in Colombo and where further new hotels are shooting up with a 1000 plus rooms each.  Galle Face is large and traditional and a little worn. That said the buffet on the terrace for breakfast or lunch are good value (particularly if included as part of your package) with a warm sea breeze and there are two other restaurants and a beach bar.   Rooms are a modest, reasonable size and most over look the sea."	Date of stay: October 2018

We struggled to turn the tv on, not sure if it was just us. Great location. Than you for a lovely stay."	Date of stay: October 2018
Kathrynowl91	Calm in busy colombo	"We stayed here at the end of our trip to Sri Lanka, it is a beautiful old hotel full of charm and atmosphere. In the  travellers bar there are photos of famous people who have stayed there in the past. The hotel in on the beach front so even when you are sitting in the terrace bar you can here the sea. There are lots of seating areas to choose from. The rooms are clean and serviced very well. Breakfast is a buffet which has foods from around the world so something for everyone. We had really good cocktails in the travellers bar. We had the buffet on our last evening. This was very good with great choice. The staff were all very helpful. I would recommend the hotel."

Rogheathertrips	Best hotel in Colombo	"On our recent trip to Sri Lanka we stayed here and absolutely loved it It’s a great place for many reasons, great location, very clean, excellent and very helpful staff from front desk to restaurants to room cleaners, concierge etc.  The colonial ambiance gives it the Grand feeling, the lovely long corridors are great for relaxing in the sea breezes, and the food in all the restaurants is very good.  We booked a Premier Deluxe ocean view room which came with so many complimentaries like happy hour everyday, breakfast, a complimentary dinner each and an all inclusive mini bar with snacks and drinks. The room we had was large, spacious and quiet with very comfortable beds.

We did have a problem with our room booking when we first arrrived and it was sorted and we were able to check in at 10.30 am.  The room wasn’t large but had lovely decor and a great bathroom. We spent a couple of days by the pool which was lovely, and had lunch at the pool bar try the curries they are fab. We drank in the Travellers bar on a night and found the staff and ambiance fabulous, I would recommend a pins cocktail, gorgeous The only compliant I do have is the noise on a night, we were by the road and could hear the traffic, also there were some inconsiderate people above us who seemed to spend most of the might stomping about on the wooden floors, really annoying The breakfast was also very"	Date of stay: October 2018

JPSF49	Lovely colonial hotel in an excellent location	"We stayed here for two nights and loved the old world, colonial atmosphere. Dark wood floors, whitewashed walls and lovely simple furniture. We deliberately chose this hotel over several other more modern chain hotels in the area and we did not regret it. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food is good (we ate breakfast both mornings and dinner one evening). The pool is spectacularly located looking right out over the water though there isn't really a beach and we were warned not to swim in the ocean! There is a working port not too far away and a large land-reclamation project though this did not in any way inconvenience us. Most of all we enjoyed the location right on Galle Face Green which was full most evenings with people walking, eating at the food stalls and"	Date of stay: September 2018

This is a wonderful hotel in a lovely location.  Right on the sea front.  The room we had was the Scandanavian Suite.  Wonderful room with its own large balcony and sea views.  It had a sitting room, large bathroom with separate bath and shower.  The fittings were lovely.  Bedroom was large with a large comfortable bed.  Wide screen televisions in both the bedroom and sitting room.     The hotel was full of character and because we had the suite we also had the use of the Long Room.  This was tea and coffee with snacks all day and ""happy hour"" from 5.30 until 7.00.  There were canopes at this time and unlimited alcoholic drinks including"	Date of stay: October 2018

The atmosphere is fantastic, however not all staff is that service oriented. E.g. checking in took too long. Perhaps because of the age of the hotel it misses the luxury and comfort of modern hotels. At least it was a great experience to stay here for a night!"	Date of stay: October 2018

Jenny Gee	Beautiful historic Hotel	We arrived very late at night and were delighted to discover we had been upgraded to the Ceylon Suite. It was huge and full of old world charm with fantastic views from three windows  to the sea and onto to the Galle Face Green. The bath could have fitted two people in it easily. The staff were fantastic and the breakfasts were delicious.	Date of stay: October 2018
Flans_Travel	Colonial Opulence	"A wonderful hotel that offers an experience of colonial history with a dash of elegance and comfort. Comfortable and clean rooms, polished surroundings and an extremely enjoyable cocktail terrace and whiskey bar should guarantee an enjoyable stay. The breakfast array was also very impressive. Great stuff!"	Date of stay: February 2018
TVTravelGuru	"Beautiful, historic, dreamy"	"The hotel gave us the wrong room at check in. When we pointed this out, they switched us to the junior suite that we booked but the room was filled with termites on the walls, windows, furniture, and blankets. We told them about the termites immediately but we spent the night because it was late and we were exhausted. The next morning, we asked for a new room and they upgraded us to the Scandinavian Suite which was very clean and no termites.  The manager Siddique is amazing. Take the heritage historic tour of the hotel, it’s free! The sunset drinks and snacks in the Long Room are delicious and a great view of the ocean at sunset. Breakfast is amazing."

Kiwi_Traveller45	Smell the wood polish...	"Plenty going on in this historic hotel, with weddings occurring on a daily basis. Rooms in the southern wing are more than normal average size with  bath and shower. Rooms look right down towards beach frontage and you literally go to sleep listening to waves crashing on the beach. Extensive and excellent buffet, which varies each day.Only disappointment were the cocktails which were decidedly ""weak"". Multiple levels if building mean some steps if you have limited mobility. Excellent staff, watch for the ""slingshot boys"" on duty near the buffet lounge."	Date of stay: October 2018

CVT100	Lovely period hotel- stepping back in time a 100 years! Very special.	"Spent the last night of our Sri Lanka holiday at the Galle Face Hotel- and it was a wonderful way to end the holiday.  It is a colonial period hotel- apparently the oldest in SE Asia.  It’s been very well maintained with beautiful furnishings, carpets, decorations. There are 2 main restaurants - a pool/ bar/ restaurant and a larger restaurant. Seawater external pool with sun beds around which was lovely, all overlooking the crashing sea which is just spectacular and so lovely to be by. There is a large spa area, which looked lovely- used the jacuzzi in the changing area- but all very good quality. Buffet breakfast excellent.   Bedroom nice, simply furnished in a period style. Comfortable bed. The hotel is more about the ‘experience’ rather than anything else and the sense of"	Date of stay: October 2018

1967-lady	A classic though a little worn	We were told this is a must do on any trip to Sri Lanka and I have to say their breakfast buffet was outstanding. The walls of the hotel's bar are jammed with photos of celebrities past and present who have chosen to stay here. The building is quite magnificent and must have been an incredible sight back in the day. I must admit though I was a little disappointed. I thought it would be a far more luxurious stay. Our room was small and the furnishings and fixtures seemed tired. Also the pool area seemed in a state of disrepair and not somewhere I felt comfortable to laze.	Date of stay: March 2018
HiAce	"A must do. Classical high end, old style Hotel."	"A must do when in Colombo. Either stay or dine in. We were three persons with two sea side suites. Access to club level with beautiful Hors D Oeuvres during happy hour. Beautiful large rooms with the sound of the sea ever present. Wide hallways reminiscent of days and architectural style long gone. Buffet was huge, plentiful choice both local and international. Breakfast was a long lingering affair. Historical tour including the hotels own museum was well worth the time and really introduced one to the hotel and environments. The seaside pool is a gem.  So is the senior citizen, suited ""crow shooter"" with his sling shot. The Galle Face Green and all its ambience abuts the hotel."	Date of stay: August 2018

The room was spacious and nice but the wall was full of small tiny micro bugs. The bugs, if I’m not mistaken, comes from damp area. There was a loud bang in the middle of the night and I could hear water falling off like shower. It was noisy. Then, they decided to spray insecticide at around 4am which was very noisy.

ab65	Hide Your Face	"This hotel is broken down in several ways. Since it is an old British-era building bult in 1857, all floors are wooden. Not only do all the floors creak, so do the doors, cabinets, etc. You can hear creaking noises from other rooms as well, making it very annoying.   The staff at the F&B outlets forgot how to smile or never learnt. Menu at Dinner buffet is almost 80% same as the breakfast buffet. They have done away with their infused cocktails which they used to be once famous for.  The only positive is that it is the only hotel actually on the beach."	Date of stay: September 2018

You are greeted by the staff in their very smart suits, holding the door open and taking your baggage. They really cannot do enough for you.   We were treated to fizz, cake, chocolates and fruit in our room on arrival.!   The room is very clean and looked after. Our view from the room looked out to the swimming pool and also the sea.  The sunset was amazing!   We are at the Inn on the green and took part in the quiz night whilst there.  We both had burger and chips - very tasty. They have happy hour offer on drinks too!

It was quite large, with two beds, a large bathroom, separate room with toilet & washbasin.  Absolutely lovely.  And the big plus, you have use of the 'Long Room' on the 2nd floor, which has refreshments available all day, without additional charge.  You can sit inside or out, with a view of the ocean.

The Verandah bar has photos of the famous people who have stayed at this hotel over more than 100 years. It is even better to stay there. I had a room on the second floor that opened onto a marge verandah overlooking Galle Face Green. The room was very spacious with a large, modern bathroom.

Built in 1864, Galle Face Hotel is a lovely colonial style building, beautifully maintained with all the modern amenities.  Flanked by the Indian Ocean on one side, and located in the heart of Colombo  amidst the modern high-rise buildings / hotels dominating the sky line, the hotel’s gleaming off white facade of tall stately columns and red tiled roof make a lovely contrast, and transports one to a different time and age.

We had taken the 8 seater plane from Trincomalee and arrived a little bit early to check in, but they found a room for us within an hour and it was an upgrade to a junior suite, although somewhat tucked away through the spa downstairs. As it was our last night, we enjoyed a fabulous meal in the 1864 restaurant which was quite special. The following day we were due to catch a late plane, but the normal checkout was at 12 and we were able to use the facilities of the hotel, including the absolutely fabulous swimming pool, until we left at about 6.

I was a single traveller who had family dropping in to see me during my stay - they made a point of welcoming my visitor and making them feel equally welcome.  The pace of life in the hotel is a welcome relief from the bustle of Colombo, but the central location of the hotel means that you can jump into the busy city in seconds when you want to.  The selection of food in the restaurant and bar is excellent - all tastes are catered for and provision was made for diabetics and guests with gluten and dairy intolerances too.

So when we got to the hotel we upgraded our two rooms to one room where we three would fit in and we were told the only additional cost would be a roll out bed in case we thought the two queen beds were not sufficient. Over time it turned out we were being charged for the third persons breakfast, happy hour - even though we were told breakfast and happy hour was complementary. Each hotel staff told us different things and were extremely confused.so make sure you claify any booking amendments with hotel staff multiple times.

And after I experienced it rather fully, I additionally perceived that the place was designed with the simple precept: ‘just you and the sea’; everything else is behind – literally. Some excellent accommodation, supplemented by some exclusive dining facilities. The rooms, corridors, are on an old-world architectural base, but well-maintained with a touch of modernity; classy. No crowd of guests as if they also need to be in just the right number.   Its location: superb.

Nomals	Distrusting of Sri Lankan guests	"I was visiting Sri Lanka with 9 of my friends from the US (all of them white) and it was very interesting how the front desk lobby staff was always distrusting of me (dark-skinned Sri Lankan). They only give one room key (I was sharing a room with two others), so we had to leave the key at the reception desk so that we can each go our seperate ways and grab the key from the reception whenever one of us returned. Each time I went to ask for the room to my key, they Sri Lankan (similiarly dark-skinned staff) would always look at my somewhat suspiciously and ask ""madam, are you staying at this hotel?""...a question they never asked any of my white friends.

The entrance to the hotel is very grand and looks out to the famous Galle Face Green where the city goes to chill out in the evening (although it is no longer very green - more brown). Check in was smooth and helpful (although I did ask a question about a particular store and no one came back to me with the answer as promised).   Our room looked out over the pool and ocean and was a good size with a comfortable bed and nice bathroom with a spa. I believe the hotel has had a bit a refit recently but I felt like it still needed some work; maybe some more Sri Lanka themed art in the room (rather than a plant picture)? It just felt a bit bland	Date of stay: August 2018

k B	"Old world charm, museum inside the premises, beachfront property"	"This hotel is significant not only for its location but also its place in history. The museum will boast of Prince Philip's car and also a listing of renewed personalities around the world who have walked and stayed inside its walls. I visited to attend a meeting at the back wing where the museum is located. Their service was impeccable and the afternoon tea selection of sandwiches and cakes were delectable. The views from the beach were fantastic, they also have a flag retreat where bagpipes play at sundown. Best place to be when the sun sets."	Date of stay: August 2018
Peter B	Lovely hotel but!	"Amazing hotel and we are still here. I've stayed in the cinnamon grand and lakeside which are great hotels. However the galle face wins hands down. Plus side is the staff are more than fantastic, but when there is a wedding normal guests are forgotten. The bufee was meant to be a Thai night but was left overs from the night before all for £70 for 3 for below par food. And the wedding music might as well been in our room.  I might sound a whinger but have a 5 month old who screamed for 2 hrs. Again hotel and staff are great and 5 ??... I would change a few things but deffo come again.. but would check for weddings.  5 ?? for the staff!"	Date of stay: September 2018

Davidlloyd12	Incredible!	"My girlfriend booked us in for a nights stay in this amazing colonial place prior to heading home. She’d read about it in the ‘Tea Planters Wife’ book.   We had the suite with balcony and ocean view!!! Stunning. The rooms were fab.   We had a lazy 2 days here apart from myself having had a workout in the small gym. Lounged by the pool and drank. We wanted for nothing more.   We went to the 1864 restaurant for a nice meal, and that it was! Opted for the Chicken and Pasta dishes as main courses. The wine selection was extensive, and some great choices on there. We managed a bottle of the Riesling.   Breakfast was incredible, loads of choice on the buffet.  The only negative was when asking how much a car would be to the airport was they told us 6,000Rps. We did some some research"	Date of stay: September 2018

The rooms, the service is wonderful, the pool is divine, the restaurants are delicious and the cocktails (try a Vivien Leigh!) are amazing. I promise you will love staying here. The history of this hotel is worth a look at in their own little museum that is beautifully presented. You can also do a tour of the hotel but be sure to book as it does not run every day. There are some great places to eat around town but you'll want to make sure you do some eating and drinking here too! Do not miss happy hour for hotel guests with free (yes free) drinks and yummy nibbles. Select your own seafood at the restaurant by the beach (eat indoors if it's hot!!!). There was a large group of us for dinner and the seafood restaurant staff"	Date of stay: May 2018

Philosphie	Restaurant overlooking the sea	"I have been there now on 2 occasions with relatives for evening tea.  There is a wide range of offerings available from vegetarian (which are few) to sea food and meats.  I think the better option is to check with the waiter (as they are  font of knowledge regarding the local cuisine).  They serve 'on the house' biscuits or chips depending on the time. When you order food there is always extras as sides.  The main drawback is the time taken for food preparation.  If you are in a hurry check how long it takes to be served. Same with payment.  Otherwise, staff are friendly courteous and helpful"	Date of stay: August 2018
Nicola R	Beautiful setting	The hotel and room was beautiful. Sitting at the travellers bar or on the verandah. The only reason I wouldn’t give 5 stars is the drink and food service is very slow.

We arrived too early to get into the room but were able to have coffee and relax on the awesome terrace of the Travellers Bar, surrounded by the sights and sounds of the ocean only metres away. The service was at all times excellent and although the hotel is proud of its significant past it was able to offer us access to the most up to date technology to do some necessary work. Our room on the 3rd floor was small but beautiful and very well appointed but sadly without a view of the ocean. In the evening we met friends in the bar again and witnessed the unexpected but magical evening ritual with the bagpipes being played as the Sri Lankan flag is taken down for the night. We thought this couldn't be beaten for spectacle but we were"	Date of stay: August 2018
TravellingBish	"More than just a hotel, but an average hotel in itself"	"We started our Sri Lanka trip with a night in this piece of history and didn't regret it one bit, it was a fascinating place to stay - everywhere you turned there was another little insight in to times gone by, all of which preserved and displayed very well. However, if looked at solely as a luxury hotel, which is what it is at the end of the day, The Galle Face Hotel did not cut the mustard.   We arrived early (9am) and were told our room wouldn't be ready until 2pm which was not a problem and to be expected. We went for a walk, had lunch and returned just after 2pm to be told it still wasn't ready. We were told they would let us know when it was ready so we went for a drink in the bar, and then another drink before going back to reception to ask about the room - still not"	Date of stay: July 2018

It was as I had expected a rather grand colonial hotel in the mould of a Raffles.  The reception staff were fantastic and couldn't have been more helpful. Our travel agent had annoyingly booked us two rooms - we have children - which wasn't ideal (none of the previous 5 hotels we'd stayed in were done like this), but the reception guys gave us a free upgrade to junior suite. This was lovely. clean and tastefully decorated though sadly with no view other than a car park! The contents of the mini bar were complimentary which was nice.  There is a pool which is decent sized and nice and deep and is mildly salty. Sadly not enough room for enough sun beds around it though. There are at least three bars"	Date of stay: August 2018

Although communication with waiters is still a big issue here because of the bad knowledge of English.   The pool is well maintained but the pool boy needs a quick course in how to handle ladies who are alone at the pool.  In our country they receive the same respect as men."	Date of stay: August 2018

Mark I	Stunning colonial style hotel with loads of history	"We loved the Galle Face Hotel and our only 'complaint' was that as it was the last night of our holiday, we didn't get the most out of the hotel. It is one of the most historic buildings in Colombo and has a real history, with many famous previous guests - it even has its own museum!  The style internally is all colonial - and you get a real feel of being in an old world. It clearly is very popular and was very busy - and looked as though weddings/conferences took place frequently here. It right on the sea front and next to the Galle Face Green, which comes alive at night with numerous street food vendors selling good quality, cheap food. The hotel has a lovely bar & open-covered dining room, a further bar near the sea and a pool - such a shame we couldn't experience them. The"	Date of stay: August 2018

AlexandraEvirano	"Beautiful colonial hotel, some renovating required"	"This is a lovely British colonial hotel from 1864, overlooking the sea. Overall it’s beautiful, but it does feel a bit tired and dated in some areas of the hotel that hasn’t yet been renovated.  Recommend to stay in the comfortable newly renovated rooms as the non renovated rooms although spacious are quite old from the 1970s and therefore a bit dated! We asked for a room change and it was worth it! Issue is that only the double rooms have been renovated (not the twin rooms) and walls are thin but it wasn’t a problem for us. The minibar is complementary and the wifi works well. Service was very good overall, staff are friendly and very keen to help.  A la carte food is very good (we didn’t try the buffet) and breakfast was superb, both located at a terrace overlooking the sea!"	Date of stay: August 2018
ALou	Disappointing	We stayed here on the last night of our honeymoon. We had high expectations and  were delighted when we were upgraded to a suite. Unfortunately it all went downhill from there. There was a lot of hair on the floor and in the shower in the bathroom and toilet. We were aiming to have an early night because we were flying home the next morning. This was impossible as there was a function being held below us and the music was so loud that the floor was shaking. We could not believe that a hotel would allow music to be played at this volume when they clearly have guests who want to sleep. We found the overall service to be quite average.  It is a very beautiful hotel and the location on the water is amazing. Perhaps we were unlucky that we stayed the same night as a function. We	Date of stay: July 2018

Located on the beach, the hotel has a spectacular outlook to the Indian Ocean.  The beach/park to the right of the hotel is a mix of markets, with locals spending time with their families on the weekend flying kites - which looks amazing.  Rooms are well appointed and staff super friendly.  We used the expeditions service to book cars to take us to Kandy and Galle.  Well worth it and surprisingly not that expensive.  Food is outstanding, a mix of local and western cuisine for those who aren’t so adventurous.    Good location for couples or families"	Date of stay: August 2018

Rooms are large and comfortable. Bathrooms have separate shower and tub areas.  Breakfast spread is vast with various cuisines available. Staff is attentive and always smiling. Interestingly, there are squirrels and crows in the garden in front of the breakfast area ready to grab food from your plate if you are not attentive. Two staff are dedicated on the lawns with slingshots and laser pens to keep an eye on them to shoo them away. I found this very interesting.

Jenningsburyhouse	Most disappointing of all the hotels we stayed at in Sri Lanka!	"I booked this hotel having read about its history, colonial charm and excellent reviews following recent renovations.  I was so disappointed, the hotel claims to be a 5* establishment, but it is 3* at best. Positives: The view of the sea from our junior suite was stunning.  Our room was spotlessly clean. The pool was lovely to swim in. Lunch by pool terrace was fairly good in terms of quantity and taste. The ceremony of lowering the flag accompanied by a piper was worth seeing. A birthday cake was left in our room for my husband which was a nice touch (although by the time we returned to the room to find it, it was covered in ants!). Negatives: The junior suite was very drab and tired looking. The sun loungers/parasols by the pool desperately need replacing and upon arriving at"	Date of stay: July 2018

The staff was friendly and helpful, and we loved every opportunity we had to talk with them. We used room service, the traveller's bar, and the buffet numerous times, and enjoyed them greatly. I responded poorly to something I ate at High Tea, but that could have been an allergy. A notes that is not apparent from the pictures and website: There really is not much of a beach. The hotel has a 70-100' stretch of shore, and we found seaglass, shells, and lots of crabs to watch, but that is all there is. Anywhere. The rest of the shore is developed overlooks.

Salt water pool and lounges overlooking the ocean, good curry dinner and nice breakfast.  We were there on a Saturday night so walked along the waterfront of Galle Green watching hundreds of locals flying kites and enjoying their dinner next to the sea.

Elinor C	Quintessentially Old English	"Looking for a little piece of Old England and how things (I imagine) use to be, then this is the hotel for you. Yes it's old and yes it could do with an upgrade but I have no complaints what so ever. With it being old- the rooms are spacious, there are not 50 rooms on one floor with doors right next to each other, you have space and with space comes privacy. So you weigh up what's important for you and your stay. The breakfast was magnificent and I mean magnificent and the 1864 restaurant was superb with a fantastic array of culinary delights. The staff are probably the friendliest staff you could ever wish to meet. Really went out of their way to ensure your stay was most enjoyable. An absolute joy to ha e stayed there. Very like the Raffles in Singapore. Would I stay there"	Date of stay: August 2018

We were eventually taken to our superior deluxe which turned out to be a gloomy little room with no view, paper thin walls and a baby crying next door.  This hotel is overpriced with taxes that increase every bill by a third. The terrace was lovely though and I suggest you visit for a cocktail in the evening and stay somewhere nicer."

When we got there we  were a little bit worried since the hotel is located near the city center where a lot of sites are now under construction, however there's nothing to worry about (some) rooms and breakfast terrace are facing the sea and since the hotel is U shaped when you stay inside you really get the feeling that you are somewhere calm  far away from the city. The rooms were clean & well designed (the lamps <3 <3 <3).  The downside were the 1) size of the room , it was really small in comparison to other hotels ranging in the same price category and 2) the minibar, there was water and two local sodas (and few snacks) - I know it's tacky but one - just one - can of pepsi/cola would have"	Date of stay: July 2018

Breakfast buffet was included which was the same every day but still enjoyable and the evening canapés and complimentary drink hour for suite guests in the long room bar was fantastic.

Bathrooms were modern and functional. Quality of the towels was a little disappointing. We had access to the Long Room and really enjoyed pre dinner drinks and nibbles there. Breakfast was okay but not great. Good choice of food on offer but it felt a bit like a cafeteria. Very busy. Great views though.  The staff were helpful and the housekeeping guys were super. We used the hotel car one evening to go into town for supper. The driver had very poor English and got lost...taking 30 mins for a 10minute journey. We used Uber the second night.worked brilliantly and a quarter of the cost of the hotel car.	Date of stay: July 2018

Gym is very good size for a hotel, pool by the beach is nice, lots of places to relax and have a drink in the evening.

We dined at 1874 which was excellent on all levels. I spent hours at the day spa in the hands of exceptional staff. Breakfasts were beautifully executed. I tried Curries like I have never tasted before. Swam in the pool daily and in the end was reluctant to leave.  The decor is perfectly executed for the glorious building that it is. Sophisticated colour palates and seductive spaces make you not want to leave.

Surath P	Don't drive	"This is one of the oldest hotels in Colombo. How ever, parking could be quite a nightmare if you happen to go there when they have a reasonably big event in one of their halls.  Worst part is that they stop valet parking once the parking slots I  the visinity are over. I have not seen this policy in any other hotel.  The security staff is generally unhelpful and indifferent and borders on being rude. The facilities, public toilets ECT are good though may not be called top of the range.  Next time when I have to go there I would take a taxi and I will definitely not tip the security staff."	Date of stay: July 2018

X6714NWpaulas	Great old fashioned Colonnial charm combined with slick professional service	"Just had a wonderful couple of days at this hotel. our room was in the old part. Quite small but full of charm. Rooms have been recently renovated so had traditional decor/ furniture but newly and freshly decorated. Have previously stayed in both parts of the hotel and this room was lovely. Nice bathroom too. Service was slick, food excellent and although you are based in central Colombo where it’s very very busy, we didn’t feel it. It felt calm inside. Our room (Premier Ocean View room also included breakfast, a free minibar (soft drinks) and also club access to all beverages and hot food in the evenings. We had a huge balcony.  This is our third or fourth visit to this hotel and would really recommend. We also stayed at The Mount Lavinia hotel at the end of our tour and that"	Date of stay: July 2018
Saskia T	Afternoon tea	"This review is only about the afternoon tea, not about the hotel. The afternoon tea was very good. From the veranda overlooking the ocean I enjoyed a luxurious tea. Since it was so hot outside they even brought me an ice coffee to start off with. The food of the afternoon tea was a nice mix of West and east. Price is very reasonable"	Date of stay: May 2018

Ahmed Orabi	Charming!	"I stayed for a couple of days in a junior suite for a business trip. Staff are friendly and helpful.  Room was spacious even for the standards of a suite, neat and very clean. Bathroom was relaxing. Outdoor seating for lunch at Verandah restaurant is lovely. Hotel theme and style is historical and classy.  The business center, meeting rooms and conference halls and its adjacent catering areas are well equipped, luxurious and very stylish.  The beach is just across the road.  Reasonable driving time to the main shopping areas within 10 to 15 minutes. I definitely would like to stay there again"	Date of stay: March 2018
pdasgupta0105	Weekend break in Sri Lanka	Great location and beautiful hote. Staff very hospitable. Really took care of you. Very old school and that was really nice. Rooms facing on to the street at the back are very noisy and being an old hotel the sound proofing was low. Food is great but would be good to see more of the local fare rather than the international food options.	Date of stay: July 2018
John C	7 - 16 July Stay	"Best place I have ever stayed in Colombo. I have been traveling to Colombo for years. Usually stayed in  Hilton of Cinnamon Grande, as Galle Face was under reconstruction. The refurbished Galle Face is beautiful. But personal service is excellent at all levels and appears 'sincere' in comparison with the other hotels I have experience of in Colombia. Not sycophantic, but humorous and very personable. This is a really special hotel. Whilst not a Spa person, the upgraded amenities are the best I have experienced in many hotels."	
SCHHI32	Pretty much awesome	"This is a lovely hotel with stunning views and great food.  A few small items made our stay a tad less than spectacular, but overall, it was still very good.  First, our bathroom shared a pocket door (that could not open) with one of the lounge areas on the 2nd floor.  It was kinda odd using the restroom and hearing talking, laughing, etc. just a few feet away.  Second, we had bugs in our room on two occasions during our week long stay.  Nothing came home with us, which was my main concern, but still, kinda odd.  Third, management ""accidentally"" included a welcome letter (with our name on it) in our packet inviting us to the Long Room for complementary cocktails each evening.  The one time we went, we were rather rudely told we were not entitled to be there and would be charged"	Date of stay: July 2018
Leigh K	The Best	"If you want a hotel with character and old world charm, but one that still makes you feel like royalty, this is your place. We absolutely loved our stay here. The staff is amazing, smiles everywhere, the service is top-notch, and the food is superb. We had a buffet breakfast included during our week here, and we loved it. We also frequented the other restaurants and none of them disappointed. I would highly recommend this hotel for the service, the high standard for excellence, and the location. You can't beat an ocean view in the heart of all the city action!"	Date of stay: July 2018
Sathi S	Becoming too expensive!	"My favourite hotel in Colombo ! Raffles of Sri Lanka !  I have stayed here many times , recently noticed that price per night has gone up significantly !! To reflect this there has not been any improvement in the services ! Can get busy with weddings !! Unfortunately the coffee shop has been removed , it was a great place to relax with good quality Sri Lankan pastries!"	Date of stay: August 2017
SurreyRumPunch	Such a shame.	"We booked the Galle Face hotel for the last night of our trip to Sri Lanka. We splashed out on a junior suite to make our last night special.  We were in fact upgraded to a bigger suite which was very nice. The hotel decor is delightful with lovely sea views. But...... the service was a let down.   My husband and I were sharing the suite with our teenage son and requested an extra bed at time of booking. When we arrived we asked for the extra bed to be put in the room. It didn’t arrive, so on our way out for a spot of shopping we asked again and were assured it would be delivered to the room whilst we were out. When we returned ..... still no bed.  We rang reception and asked for the third time, to be told it would be done whilst we were at dinner. On return from dinner, still"	Date of stay: July 2018

Leisa L	Great start to holiday	Galle Face Hotel is a beautiful colonial hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful and the location for breakfast was divine. Pool setting cocktails at sunset were fabulous and interconnecting rooms great for the family.	
Karen M	My favorite hotel in the world	A big call but it has so much charm and I think has more to offer than some of the other old grand hotels. Staff fantastic including Keith Fernando who looked after my room needs so well.   The food is amazing and occasionally I was entertained by a lavish wedding in front of the sea.

Rollo B	A stay at Galle Face Hotel will be remembered for life	"We have just spent a week at this Hotel. The Staff provided every help and assistance.

diana	A Hotel to Avoid	"We booked for three nights into this well known hotel at the start of a fortnight of travelling around Sri Lanka. However our expectations were soon dashed. All five people in our party came down with symptoms of food poisoning although none of us ate anywhere outside the hotel. One of our party ended up in hospital where she was diagnosed with Campylobacter. The remaining four of us were less badly affected but the incident ruined the start of our holiday. We were disappointed that the hotel not only took no responsibility, but showed no concern and offered no apology. Their attitude was arrogant and uncaring. Despite being highly experienced travellers we were all left shocked and dismayed and under no circumstances would recommend anyone to stay here. I’m glad to say this bad"	Date of stay: September 2017

Bazeer	Food & service at the 1864 restaurant was very good.	"I wanted to dine at continental restaurant ,since I had dined at the Capital bar  & Grill at the Shangri-La Colombo and experienced the food and service to be one of the best in Colombo , overall .  The choice on offer on the menu was limited but the staff was willing to go that extra mile.   Well Done 1864 !"	Date of stay: July 2018
Suz B	Stay at this hotel	"If you enjoy some old style charm, similar to Raffles, Singapore stay here. We had a seaview room which was very large. The bed and bedding was very comfortable. The giant spa bath in the middle of the room novel, and the after 5's canapes excellent. Breakfast was delicious and the service flawless. Staying right next to Galle Face Green was a bonus, and a late afternoon walk down the promenade is certainly an experience worth having."	Date of stay: July 2018

curioustraveller104	Mixed Feelings	"I have very mixed feelings about this hotel and I'll tell you why:  I stayed here for 6 nights whilst on business in Colombo. It is true when other reviews say it is an old style, grand hotel and it is by far the most famous in the city.   The breakfast selection was adequate, but having stayed at the Cinnammon Grand before this, their breakfast selection is much better. It was adequate enough to fill me up at breakfast however. Their cereals had gone stale after being reused or being left out for too long. I complained to a staff member that their cereals were stale, and they didnt know what stale meant, they asked me to spell it for them and I dont think they still understood.   In terms of lunch, we didnt eat at the hotel much as were always out for meetings, but one time we"	Date of stay: June 2018

cassie1298	Old style grandeur	"Two nights in Colombo staying at the Galle Face. A lovely old style hotel on the waterfront. A Colombo institution. Rooms were large and well equipped, staff friendly and attentive, would certainly recommend it. Ate in the beach bar one night and had drinks there the second. Food was good and reasonably priced for where you are, other restaurants in hotel we’re a bit more pricey and smarter but still good value. The pool was lovely and overall hotel facilities were first rate, remember this is an old colonial hotel and it feels like it.  Colombo itself is a mad “Indian”city with all the contrasts and challenges you would expect in this part of the world, the Dutch hospital is a wee oasis in the storm, lovely for a coffee and a sit down before hitting galleface green or slave"	Date of stay: July 2018
Belinda R	Beautiful grounds	"This hotel has stunning grounds. Pool and restaurants face the ocean which makes for beautiful sunset and breakfast views. Staff at the restaurant for dinner her helpful and friendly and the breakfast buffet had some delicious choices. A downside would be a location, as there is not much around, for example, I had to walk for around 10 minutes to find a working ATM. However, I’m not sure anywhere in Colombo would have an ideal location and they do have Tuk Tuks waiting outside. As for the rooms, the bathroom is beautiful and spacious but the actual room is slightly on the smaller side. Overall, a comfortable and pleasant stay."	Date of stay: April 2018
liwu2	Too expensive for the standard double rooms	"The hotel is nice, very luxurious. But the standard double room is just ok. You can hear every word from the next room, the bathroom is ok. The price is not really reasonable for nothing is included (not even breakfast -15$) The service is grest of course but all in all would not come again."	Date of stay: June 2018
TracieJC	Wonderful old hotel	"We have just spent three days at this wonderfully old hotel. It is just as good on the interior as the exterior. With its position on the coast and it’s history, it truly was a unique place to stay. The breakfast buffet was lovely but we did not eat any other meals in the hotel. The lounge areas - inside and out, are fabulous for drinks.  The staff were excellent and nothing was too much trouble."	Date of stay: June 2018

lucielou1507	Beautiful hotel in the city	"We loved Galle Face, an amazing old hotel with a rich history and beautiful rooms. The Traveller’s Bar makes great cocktails and the view of the ocean from the bar is stunning. Brilliantly helpful staff and very centrally located, though not noisy in the rooms at all. The only negative would be that the breakfast is a little pricey, but if you wanted to fill up on the entire buffet then you could definitely get your money’s worth!   Situated right by the main beach, you can walk out the front door and start experiencing the hustle and bustle of Colombo right away."	Date of stay: June 2018
Leanne P	Relaxed gentility and superb service.	"Our 4th stay at this iconic hotel as a family of 4 adults occupying 2 junior suites impressively and attentively serviced by “Keeth,” for whom nothing was too much trouble. The selection and quality of the Sri Lankan cuisine has delighted us on every visit and even more so on this occasion. The local cuisine is admirably complemented by a rotation of other international cuisines. Once again, the service of staff throughout the hotel, from doormen through to porters and wait staff in the dining room, at the pool bar and the verandah bar, has been charming and attentive. Definitely a place to return to, to restore and revive through its exemplary hospitality."	Date of stay: June 2018
Eduardosm729	Old hotel	"The hotel is good but old. The renovation is only on public areas not in the rooms. My room had a not nice smell of wet wood and lots and lots of ants! Staff is very friendly, breakfast in open air very charming."	Date of stay: June 2018
Sheridan Prasso	Both business and leisure	"I initially booked for the first few days of my business trip thinking that I would need to move to a more business-y hotel closer to my office, but I ended up extending for the whole week. I loved the service, the gorgeous view from my room, the nightly changes to the dinner buffet, the various locales to go and have a drink, the nightly bagpiper accompany the flag-lowering at sunset, the huge range of cocktails, and even the guy whose job is chasing away the persistent crows from our food plates with a toy gun. They've been at it since the 1860s, so I guess they've got it down by now. The view is now changing dramatically with the building of the port city, which is sucking away all the sand from the front of the hotel, but as you can't swim here anyway, it's all the more"	Date of stay: June 2018
velvettestudio	Old World Charm	"This was the best decision too stay for a few days & be introduced to the delights of Sri Lanka. This hotel carries so much history, it is the oldest hotel in Sri Lanka, has its own museum and gallery of photos of notable people who have visited over the yearsl, I highly recommend you treat yourself & stay here if you can or at least visit the museum and stay for high tea."

The staff at recpetion were very efficient and we were escorted to our room.  It is a very large rambling hotel and it took us a few attempts to find our way round, inlcudng finding the museum which had some intertesting details about the hotel and previous famous guests.  Our superior room was very classical in design and felt very colional and was of a very high standard.  There were complemntary items in the minibar whihc as such a lovely touch with tea and coffee facilities.  As we were there for poya (full moon) no alcohol as being served but this did not bother us or appear to imping on the overall atmosphere around the pool bar were we spent"	Date of stay: March 2018

We were both welcomed on arrival shown the hotel and told our booking included breakfast and complimentary dinner in the buffet resteraunt. On the second day we decided to go for the dinner at the end of which we were given a bill for one person. I questioned this and was told that the room was only for one person, my wife!!!!!. I questioned this with reception who confirmed this. I tried to sort this out and they said please come tomorrow and we will sort it. I went the next day and they still couldn't help me so we decided not to use the restraunt as the food was less than average anyway. Finally a day later we received a letter at the room asking us to go to reception. I went to"	Date of stay: June 2018
Peter K	We ended up in Colombo instead of Chennai	"The Galle Face is a beautiful Colonial Stile Hotel facing the Indian Ocean. It’s a Hotel since 1864 but the building is much older and has a lot of history! If you like this type of hotels like the Raffles in Singapore or the Eastern&Oreintal in Penang, then you will love it. There are all amenities like big outdoor swimming pool, SPA and Gym. There are two separate bars and three restaurants. We tested the 1864 one night and it was pretty good. The breakfast is served in a big open veranda, with lots of choice from Continental over America and local Curries. The staff is friendly and in particular the in-house travel Specialist was very helpful. You can book and tailor made all your trips to Kandy and other highlights of the island to your liking."

thambyiah	Asian Guests Feel Unwelcomed	"I found that the attitude of the F&B staff (partricularly in the Long Room and the Breakfast Verandah) was appaling as they were only interersted to smile and serve western or Japanese guests. Asians were ignored and often given a rude look. The rooms are very small and if you have a roll away bed there is hardly any space to move. Room with a balcony but it seemed like they never cleaned the balcony chairs . They do not allow TukTuk to drop you at the entrance porch even if you have luggage or purchases, rain or shine. If you are dropped off by TukTuk they don't bother to help you with luggage. So with the distance from the gate, rain and inconvenience you need to manage your luggage or purchases as well.

(And I have been traveling all over the world for a long time).  An unexpected turn of events extended my stay from two days to two weeks, but I didn't want to leave even then.  The beautiful building, built in the 1830s, is immaculately kept up.  My room was obviously one of the original rooms--beautiful dark wood floors and cabinetry, brass fittings, a high ceiling, and a tall window overlooking the sea.  It had been remodeled to accommodate a large marble-trimmed bathroom, which included a"	Date of stay: June 2018

Mark Benjamin L	The best place to eat breakfast in Colombo	Four of us had a latish breakfast on the veranda of this wonderful hotel . It is one of the very best hotels in Asia and has been refurbished carefully in recent times . The veranda is perhaps the best place of all to sit and have breakfast in Colombo - a wonderful venue overlooking the sea with waves crashing in and black crows circling to see if they can steal a bite .

twinter808	A beautiful hotel in the perfect position for exploring Colombo	"This was our final night in Sri Lanka before our long flight home.  At first glance the hotel was awe-inspiring, but the staff could not have been more welcoming or helpful.  Our upgraded room was beautiful, with fabulous views from two sides.  The room certainly met our every need.  We had initially planned to eat elsewhere, but having been shown the restaurants we decided to eat at the hotel.  The food was good and the staff attentive so we were pleased with our decision.  Many thanks for the anniversary cake."	Date of stay: June 2018
Travelbugz69	Traditional Hotel with Great Service	"We stayed for one night after arriving in Colombo.  We were welcomed with a refreshing drink and sweets, check in was quick and efficient.  We booked two rooms and were given an upgrade on one, which was huge with a Jacuzzi bath, although the room was a little dark without a view.  I can imagine the rooms overlooking the sea have magnificent views.  The hotel still maintains a traditional colonial feel and it was areal pleasure to treat ourselves to a stay here.  The staff, views over the ocean and food were all excellent."	Date of stay: June 2018

Just to let you have an idea about it: Srilankan cuisine consist indeed daily of Chicken, Dhaal and Egg curry. Nothing else! There's no other option to chose. No other sort of vegetable or meat for a change. Similar with the English cuisine. The restaurant staff is mixed from friendly to quite unfriendly waiters who simply have no fun working in the field of service. Food is not prepared in a hygienic way, daily stomach ache after eating from the breakfast buffet. This didn't happen at any other place in Colombo before. Housekeeping staff is absolutely lazy, the cleanliness is a disaster, used towels of previous guests are kept to be dried and then kept back for new guests arriving.

If you want something that is authentic to Sri Lanka instead of the standard international hotels nearby, this is a great choice. It was also a reasonable distance from the airport. Maybe 45 minutes. My friends and I stayed here for one night when we flew into Colombo before traveling to another location. This is a huge hotel, so make sure that you get rooms in the new wing because they have an old wing where the rooms are not as good. Also, the rooms that are much closer to the water can be very damp. Our room was facing the hotel's front entrance and was great. There were 3 of us and the hotel was great about getting us a third small bed added to the room. My favorite part about the room was the bathroom. Great facilities and"	Date of stay: May 2018

Its an amazing structure, beautiful location, and for those who are a fan of colonial architecture- this will tick all your boxes! It’s really very reminiscent of the old colonial period, and the management have obviously made great efforts to maintain this look and feel. They’ve done a terrific job.   They have a great area by the seashore where you can enjoy sunset drinks, seated on a chess set. The breeze is very welcome after such a hot and humid day and not too windy (like lots of places by the beach in Australia.) Food and cocktails are good, and staff very polite and attentive.

Had drinks on the balcony and got moved so they could work on the fan - unique experience watching the ocean, cocktail in hand with a ladder to your right. At dusk they go collect the flag from the beach, with bagpipes. A romantic notion but when the rain is coming in sideways and the sea has 5ft waves I felt a tad sorry for the pair. The inside bar was closed, I later learnt as the Prime minister was hosting....so you know you have chosen the right location :)    Rooms roomy but was freezing, had the AC on low but still chilly. Bed comfortable and large bathroom."	Date of stay: June 2018

It's difficult not to fall in love with this Grand Old Lady East of the Suez that's undergone a recent renovation yet retained, thankfully, an authentic colonial ambiance. The absolute seafront location is superb whilst also being just a walk away from many historic places in town.  Most of the staff are very attentive and eager to assist.

As I read in some of the comments, yes you may hear a bit of a noise from the corridors when you are in your room, but it just adds to it's charm. It is really like reliving history. I was particularly impressed with the friendliness of the staff, the flag lowering ceremony and of course the iconic ""Pimm's O'Clock"" on the terrace.  The hotel has so many hidden corners where you can just sit, read a book and absorb history. If you are looking for a corporate and modern hotel, this may not be the place for you. It was fascinating to see who has stayed here in the past, from movie & sports stars, world leaders, the Pope to even Che Guevara.  I just"	Date of stay: April 2018
Arun N	Lovely iconic property	The only hotel on the edge of the Ocean in Colombo. Apart from the fact that we for some reason got a room that had very little area around the beds... our stay was absolutely great! The hotel by itself is iconic and there is a an Old world charm and poise to it. The staff are incredibly helpful and cheerful. Spotlessly clean hotel despite the amount of activity that happens.Food is pretty good and service is excellent. It is also at a really good location to get around Colombo. One must spend time at the sea side restaurant/bar to make the experience complete.	Date of stay: May 2018

Madu Jay	Nothing closer to water	On the very edge of the ocean. The closest to the sea out of all the hotels in colombo. Can't beat the view. Nice service. Good food. Since its renovations the quality has become better. The court yard is an amazing place to be ehen the sun is setting.	Date of stay: May 2018

samgreenaway	Faded Glamour	"We were quite looking forward to staying at Galle Face for our last night in SL after reading some good reviews and learning a bit of the history of the place. Unfortunately I think we ended up in one of the ""yet to be modernised"" rooms, which was very tired looking and the air conditioning didn't work. We also booked a double room and ended up with two (fairly small) single beds pushed together, not really what you expect from a quality establishment. That said the room was perfectly clean, and the bathroom was pretty decent. The pool and outdoor bar area at this hotel is very nice, we enjoyed a swim in the sea-water-fed pool and had some nice cocktails looking out over the ocean. Based on our experience I think you can find much higher standard rooms in Colombo for your money."	Date of stay: October 2017

Nicole G	Torn Between 2 and 3 Stars - Just go for a Drink at Sunset on the Patio and Stay Elsewhere	"Recently, I stayed three nights at this historic hotel on the ocean in Colombo. I was originally planning on being there for two weeks. Needless to say, I changed hotels. The main reason I changed hotels was the bed. Some people may like a hard bed, but I do not. I had back surgery a few years, and I am usually fine. I travel throughout Asia for work, so I am pretty easy going about many things. However, I woke up stiff every morning from the hard bed. Additionally, I could hear the person in the next room snore, cough, sneeze, along with other human things. I could also hear the tv and alarm clock in the next room.The drains were also a bit slow to clear in the bathroom, and I had to ask more than once for washcloths and a laundry bag for clothes cleaning. It was really a shame"	Date of stay: May 2018

Abel	Not good enough for what you pay for	"This hotel is not worth the money. It is really expensive for what you actually get. The room is not that big, it has just a tiny window facing some houses roofs. It was really humid, all the clothes in the bag got wet due to the humidity and the beds felt like they were wet as well. Tv quality on the room was really poor, double image, pixeled... the shower wasn’t great either. Really close to the wall which will make all the water get out of the bathtub while you shower. The room controls (lights) were like 30 year old. Overall experience wasn’t great. Considering the amount of money we paid, we’re not happy with the results."

nobleabby	"Very nice hotel, but concierge is a jerk"	"The hotel was beautiful, very clean, nice, and lovely.  We were irritated after leaving because we spoke with the concierge because we were trying to decide on weather or not we should take a ride via car to Sigiriya or train.  We were originally planning on taking the train because it is cheap, comfortable, and easy although it is a longer ride (6-7 hours).  The concierge told us it takes only 1.5 hours by car to get there and took us to their accountant.  The accountant informed us it would be $200 something USD dollars.  A tuk tuk who had his own taxi company had already offered to take us for $90 USD.  So due to the information that the ride only takes 1.5 hours, we splurged for the car. The driver told us the next morning the ride takes 3.5-4 hours.  We questioned and"	Date of stay: May 2018

Nic P	Loved it! A charming 4 star hotel.	"This is not a 5 star hotel but it is a beautiful and charming 4 star hotel. The sea water swimming pool is a luxury. The restaurants are excellent. Room 3047 has lovely views.  Suggested improvements for management: (1) the bar staff needs to be improved. They are arrogant, grumpy, and lazy. They prefer to speak amongst themselves than to serve the customers. The cocktails are of unequal quality. Generally, the servings of alcohol are on the cheap side. (2) the chauffeurs: please train them properly."	Date of stay: May 2018
Explorer64	Experience history and heritage!	"If you are like me fond of history and heritage, then this hotel is for you. We were about to book the Taj Samundra when we came across Galle Face. The fact that it was established in 1864 was enough for us to read the reviews and we quickly made up our mind that this was going to be our place during the last night of our 5 days/6 nights tour to SL.  And we weren't disappointed at all!  What a location! Just across the sea, centrally located in the heart of Colombo. We were lucky to be there on the day a historic tour is organized (Tuesdays and Thursdays for one hour each) and we were completely in awe of the grand ball room and the library and other places.  We had dinner at their restaurant called Sea Spray. What an apt name! We could literally feel the sea sprays across our"	Date of stay: May 2018

Alok C	What a great start to our wonderful holiday in Sri Lanka	"We started our Sri Lanka holiday with a stay in Galle Face hotel for a couple of nights. The location of the hotel is excellent on the sea shore with waves hitting the embankment. The view from the restaurant, where we had our breakfasts each morning, is to die for. There are some historical items including a small museum as part of the hotel which has a car that the Duke of Edinburgh apparently purchase for 12 pounds. The room we stayed in was spacious and comfortable and the hotel exudes grandeur.  The only downside for us was the service we got in the ""Travellers Bar"" one day for lunch. Otherwise a great stay."	Date of stay: November 2017

Anna S	I don't know why you would stay anywhere else!	We recently stayed at Galle Face Hotel a second time and loved it. The breakfast on the verandah looking out at the sea is second to none. The food is excellent. The rooms are spacious and feel fresh despite the heritage look and feel. We love the pool overlooking the sea. Staff gave my two young nieces toy elephants to make them feel welcome. One suggestion: don't get rooms overlooking the road or the Galle Face Green as they can be a bit noisy. We have also stayed at the Taj across the road and the Kingston and think they pale in comparison.	Date of stay: May 2018
Robert M	Romantic stay	"I stayed three nights with my girlfriend in one of the balcony suites. This hotel is superb, the room service is excellent. Having breakfast in the morning on the balcony overlooking the sea is a must. The sound of the crashing waves at night makes you fall asleep instantly. The staff are incredibly helpful and attentive, going above and beyond.  The hotel is magnificent and the pool is very nice. We had a number of cocktails in the afternoon watching the sunset. I would recommend a stay."	Date of stay: May 2018

It is located right next to the president's residence, so as you drive there you can see lots of the important buildings of Colombo. The property itself is right on the sea face, and from our room we could hear the sound of the waves crashing against the shore at night, which was lovely. Walking around you get a definite colonial era feel, and the hotel has lots of grand and majestic areas and the restaurant area from where you can eat and see the water. Breakfast had a good variety and was fresh. Staff were extremely polite and welcoming."	Date of stay: January 2018
VirginiaRoss	Beautiful old world charm	We have always wanted to stay at this historic hotel and it didn't disappoint.It is probably the best hotel we have stayed in so far. The room/suite was tastefully decorated and very comfortable.The window opened  up to the view out to the stormy sea. the fresh air a delight. We were staying on a public holiday so be aware this means no hotels serve alcohol on these days . That meant only in your room so no sundowners. and sunset.It wasn't the weather for it anyway. Special thanks to the wonderful Concierge Emmanuel Adikaram who made us feel welcome and special. In our experience not all 5 star hotels do this. Cant wait to return. My only criticism would be that the pool is not an easy access and could do with steps. and rail for those that find the ladder difficult.	Date of stay: April 2018

Excellent buffet for breakfast - if you haven't tried it do have the egg hopper and accompaniments (well if you have tried it - have it again). Bars, restaurants (including what we were told is an excellent fish restaurant right by the sea), balconies to sit and take in the sunset, a pool and sunbathing area, a library (with books to be borrowed), wifi, a small museum etc, etc. ATM's around the corner to the right and a supermarket in the basement of the shopping centre next to the"	Date of stay: April 2018

We also really enjoyed sitting on the couches in the bar area- relaxing and great view.   While Colombo wasn't our favorite city, the Galle Face was a highlight of our trip.

Our balcony looked onto the ocean and all of this for $98/nt! We were able to get massages at the new L'Occitane Spa and the experience was second to none. I've had tons of massages and this is top 3 to be sure. The food was good but many options were buffet, which isn't my top choice.

The staff is very courteous and polite, and the setting overlooking Galle Face Green and the ocean is unbeatable.  The room was OK - it is well furnished but for the size and grandeur of the hotel, they are relatively small. After a 13h flight we also didn't appreciate the screaming children jumping up and down on the floor above (to be fair, we did not notify management of the issue). The best feature was the large balcony overlooking Galle Face Green, which was a great spectacle to see on a Sunday afternoon, as it fills up with locals.  On the other hand the Sea Spray seafood restaurant served excellent seafood and fish, and the breakfast buffet (I am always weary of buffets)"	Date of stay: April 2018

We (me and my family; wife and 2 grown up kids) have stayed there a couple of nights here in 2013 and now in March 2018, and it was still as good now as we remembered it!

Bathrooms while not great were still of an acceptable standard. The hotel overlooks the sea and has positioned its bars and dining facilities to enjoy this outlook. While we did not have ocassion to use it, it has a magnificent dining room with a wonderful cellar and sitting are in the lower ground area.  The main dining area overlooks the sea however, the selections for the evening buffet were very disappointing considering the status of this hotel. Breakfast was a much grander affair.

It took 23 minutes and several attempts to finally get connected with a receptionist. When I asked her why she did not answer the phone she explained she was not in her seat. (A five star hotel?)  I then requested to be connected to the catering manager. After another 15 minutes I disconnected the call.  No success. When I called the reception again, after 16 minutes she answered the phone. I requested to speak to the General Manager who was not available.   If this is how five star hotel communicates please find a more customer friendly hotel."	Date of stay: April 2018

The Galle Face hotel does both, particularly since its recent restoration. Great location, really nice food, stylish bars and a lovely quiet library, plus a pool on the ocean's edge - all in all a very special place. Total highlight for me was meeting the hotel's in-house historian, Mistica Young. It was absolutely fascinating talking to her and brought my whole holiday to vivid life."	Date of stay: April 2018

The public areas are lovely and even our standard room was spacious, comfortable and well-appointed , with a glimpse of the sea. The room was cleaned and serviced meticulously (thanks Keeth) and all the staff were attentive and obliging. The breakfast buffet is served in the delightful sea front Verandah Cafe; it is varied and of good quality, especially the cooked to order dishes, such as the egg hoppers and Sri Lankan omelette. As it was New Year, we weren't able to enjoy the famed sunset drinks and many places were closed. A dinner at the sea food restaurant was very good, with floodlit waves crashing gently just outside. A Thai themed buffet dinner was predictably a little bland and tired."	Date of stay: April 2018

His excuse was to do my laundry, which had not been requested, and why would that require room entry anyway? Next, during breakfast in the Ladies Washroom downstairs of the bar area, a male staff member stood grinning in the doorway as I came out of a cubicle to follow me to the stairs making suggestive remarks (even though I was dressed modestly in long sleeves and long skirt).

It's a great building and I always love having the high tea, it's enjoyable and the food is simplistic but good.  It won't break the bank either!"	Date of stay: April 2018
rfm013	An elegant old lady	"A very welcoming, well located and maintained hotel, truly elegant. This was our final hotel after touring with a group, so a perfect ending for us all. Rooms were well appointed with pleasant views and bed was very comfy. Liked the bathroom design being so open. Buffet meals provided a varied selection and staff were extremely helpful and courteous. Many elegant areas around the hotel, with tasteful floral arrangements and the pool area was pleasant especially for sunset drinks. High tea looked scrumptious with views overlooking the ocean. Didn't have enough time to explore and visit the museum."	Date of stay: March 2018
kathmccowen	Stepping back in time	We stayed here for one night before heading off on our tour of Sri Lanka.  The hotel is in a great location and the rooms are very good.  The pool area and bar are as well.  Dinner and breakfast were very good as well.  We didn't have time to explore the hotel which was shame but would definitely return and recommend.

mec737	Perfect ending to Sri Lanka	"We have been traveling around Sri Lanka for a week and after a 3 hour car ride from Galle, falling into Galle Face Hotel was perfect. We arrived prior to our check-in time and they made the effort to get our room ready so we could put our bags down. The Traveller's Bar has fantastic drinks and the food was great. The room itself is luxurious and spacious. The bed is so lush as are the bath towels, robes and this is the first hotel to offer slippers. Our reservation includes an afternoon tea set as well. Sri Lanka had already exceeded my expectations and Galle Face Hotel ends it on a high note."	Date of stay: April 2018
Miguel C	Memories of the old past	"This hotel preserves the memories of the old Colombo past times. If you are the kind of traveller lokking for this this is your choice. In fact the hotel has a museum inside with images an other artifacts that you can visit anytime. The main discomfort in the property, in my opinion, are the craven looking for something to eat specially at main restaurant."	Date of stay: March 2018
Lord S	Colonial oasis	"This hotel was an oasis of calm in the hustle and bustle of Columbo. Staff were happy to advise on travel plans and transport (tuk tuk for local Tavel and private car for day trips and travel to different locations). Food was good, recommend breakfast buffet for a hearty start to the day or healthy options for those avoiding the temptation of a big breakfast every day. Rooms were cool (the Sri Lankan heat can be a bit oppressive), the pool and poolside bar was a great way of recovering from long flights and sightseeing."	Date of stay: May 2017

A wonderful place to stay however be very careful what you eat from the buffet! I recommend not to eat any seafood.	Date of stay: December 2017
Min4647	Hotel on the Water Front	This hotel is very historic with actors and film stars visiting.  Lots of photos of years gone by.  Walk out the front door and you can walk on the water front passing booths of people selling water to selling memorabilia. Dining area overlooks the ocean with beautiful lawns and manicured gardens. Rooms were big!  Staff very pleasant.	Date of stay: February 2018
NickandMaretha	A Grand Old Lady....so expect some wrinkles	"We booked a ""Superior Room"" to discover that this definition is the entry level for the hotel. After politely pointing out that it has to be superior to something else or it cannot be superior we were promptly upgraded to a room that was very comfortable and met our expectations. The hotel is enormous and wears its history with pride. Interesting old photos adorn the walls and there are some museum pieces including the Duke of Edinburgh's first car. Some of the public spaces are attractive and homely. Not the main dining room which has institutional lighting and not a plant to be seen. However, the buffet dinner and breakfast were both extensive and very good"	Date of stay: February 2018
Wilgil	Gill & Lynn Wilson	This hotel is beautifully restored and although absolutely perfect in some little area. This adds to the charm of its bi gone magnificence. After all the premises were first established in 1864. The rooms are pleasant and although not on the large size they are very comfortable. Suggest the ocean view if available. The food is excellent and the Verandah bar Restaurant is an excellent buffet style eatery with a different nightly theme. Service is very good with all staff being very eager to please given there will always be some language issues. All in all we really enjoyed our stay here and we would highly recommend if you are seeking some unique. Check out the hotel museum on the 2nd floor	Date of stay: April 2018

Boneta S	Lovely Hotel	We stayed 2 nights at this lovely hotel. It is an older hotel so some of the outside noises do filter in. We ate at two of the restaurants and the food was good. We had the breakfast buffet and there were many selections so all should be able to eat their fill! The grounds were lush and green and there were many places to sit and watch and listen to the ocean. The staff was very helpful and always willing to help with your needs.	Date of stay: March 2018
topgun45	A great start to a holiday	"We stayed for two nights on 28th February/1st March 2018. We arrived before the normal check in time, having warned the hotel that this was possible.The room was ready and available. We had a very enjoyable two nights stay. The bed was comfortable, the meals were excellent, and the service was first class. The room was adequate size, and typical colonial architecture. It is nice to stay in bedrooms with character sometimes, rather than the bland modern rooms found in most hotels. The views over the Indian Ocean are spectacular, and we were able to walk along Galle Face Green, and to the Temple to watch the procession of drummers, dancers and elephants in the evening. We shall certainly sty at the Galle Face next time we go the Sri Lanka"	Date of stay: February 2018

Kim B	A great welcome to Sri Lanka	"We enjoyed 2 nights in the Junior Suite Sea View, a perfect start to our holiday with amazing views over the Indian Ocean.  This is an old world charm place with great service, from supplies in the room to efficient guest services.  Fantastic breakfast, offering a vast array of food to select from including freshly made hoppers and roti, interesting to watch.   Make sure you find time to watch the sunset, we enjoyed a cocktail at the bar area near the pool whilst watching the sun sink into the ocean, spectacular.  A walk along the board walk during the evening will provide you with an opportunity to view the food carts, an experience.  Would definitely stay again should we return to Sri Lanka."

discerningWanderer83	One night at the Galle Face	"We were only here for a night but loved the Galle Face hotel. Lovely architecture and the room itself was a good size, clean and well appointed. We didn't have much of a view from our room, but they serve breakfast in a restaurant on the veranda facing the ocean which is a lovely way to start your morning. Service was friendly."

Andy101060	"Great building and location, but tired rooms."	"My wife and I stayed for one night prior to our return flight to London. The standard rooms are small and very overdue a refurb, but adequate for one night. The rooms are not soundproofed and the we had noisy neighbours - and little sleep.  We ate lunch and dinner in the bar and the service was poor, but food was good.  All in all a beautiful old colonial hotel in a great location, but very tired and poor service.  I would recommend staying in one of the newer hotels in the area and popping into the Galle Face to look at the building, if that interests you."	Date of stay: March 2018

There is an interesting museum which should be visited and houses Prince Philip's first car.   We stayed in a Premier Sea View Room with Balcony which was very comfortable and quiet. . We dined at Sea Spray which was excellent.   A very good hotel to start or end a tour.	Date of stay: February 2018

Emmanuel was extremely prompt in our email correspondence and in making our dinner reservations..  Breakfast on the verandah was superb with infinite and delicious choices.

Next time, as the price of the rooms is very reasonable. We visited at sunset each evening to enjoy the ambience, a few margherita's and the stylish and elegant setting. The outdoor areas are perfect for sitting and relaxing and there are spaces on the balcony and at the club bar which features black and white photos of all the well-known visitors. Great staff too."

Having arrived on the overnight flight via Dubai we were told our room would not be available until 2pm despite our agent requesting an early check in. Room very light and well appointed. In the evening we decided to dine in the fish restaurant overlooking the ocean. Superb food at a very reasonable price, much better than the buffet option. Breakfast  in the buffet had a good choice of dishes both western and Sri Lankan. Overall the hotel was in an excellent location and ideal to either start or end a trip."	Date of stay: March 2018

SteveandHazel52	"A return visit, no regrets!"	"We stayed at the Galle Face about 6 years ago, and usually resist the temptation to go back for fear it is not as we remember. But to end our tour of Sri Lanka, before flying back from Colombo, this seemed like a good idea. And indeed it was. The old building has been upgraded in certain respects without losing it's quirky, colonial charm. The rooms combine lovely authentic features (carved wood & heavy furniture) with efficient modern facilities (great walk-in rainforest shower, wifi etc.) We had a view of the ocean which I particularly loved, in-room services were excellent, efficient cleaning & plenty of towels, cold drinks in the free mini-bar etc. The public areas  resemble a museum with artefacts & pictures from old colonial times, a library with beautiful books too.

We ate in the Fish Restaurant which wasn't bad, and we thought the breakfast quite good also. Comfortable beds and well-appointed bathrooms. The numerous lifts could also be a bonus for some. The Green in front of the hotel is a bit disappointing however."	Date of stay: March 2018

Mary B	Galle Face Hotel visit	"A group of female friends ended a wonderful Sri Lanka holiday staying at the Galle Face Hotel. As with all hotels throughout Sri Lanka, we had trouble with our booking of a triple room. However, the staff were able to accomodate our, booked in advance, request on arrival with the help of our guide. The hotel is colonial, charming and is situated perfectly on the sea and facing the Galle Face Green. A fabulous buffet, salt water pool and take in the historical tour of the hotel and museum if time permits. The chequer-board patio is a perfect spot to have a drink and watch the sun go down listening to the piper. Most of the staff were fabulous, however we were very disappointed with a staff member behind the reception desk who told three of us, ""there is no shop in the hotel"" when"	Date of stay: March 2018
LynchyA	Buffet Breakfast review	"I never stayed at this hotel whilst in Colombo but I ate an outstanding buffet breakfast there. It was an incredible meal! Everything was fresh, authentic and they had a very wide variety of Sri Lankan and Western food choices. The hotel is very quiet, calm and stunning. Very clean and well maintained. The view is spectacular and you can hear yourself think amongst the hustle and bustle of Colombo life. The staff were accommodating to our small children and afterwards we were able to walk around the property. Next time I come to Sri Lanka I will be staying at this hotel as I think it ticks a lot of boxes."	Date of stay: March 2018

The hotel is on the beach and is a fabulous, grand building with beautifully dressed rooms and corridors. The room was quite small but was equipped with all of the essentials to a very high standard.  Having said that we didn't spend much time in the room.  We enjoyed sundowners in the bar and watched the sun go down over the beach - very enjoyable. And the buffet dinner and breakfast in the 1864 Restaurant were very good with a range of foods and quality ingredients.  Service from the reception staff was excellent.  Absolutely no complaints - the bit of colonial glamour that we hoped for."	Date of stay: December 2017

Swept away by the old world charm of the building. Don't worry all aircon and modern conveniences are there.  The staff were impeccable in reception, at the travel desk and round the pool wherever we went. A real delight when you walk around the city and see the modern building being constructed."

We arrived at 6 pm extremely tired and were so pleased to see that we had been allocated on the top floor a Premium Corner Ocean View Room, more like a suite, giving us a superb dual aspect view. The bed was so comfortable and we slept through the night and awoke for breakfast.  A lovely buffet and cooked breakfast outside or inside which was very relaxing and excellent quality and service. This hotel is like an oasis in Colombo and we are so pleased we stayed here before commencing our month tour of Sri Lanka. The hotel has its own museum which is well worth seeing and on a Tuesday and Thursday they give an historic tour of the hotel. You name them they have stayed here. Royalty,"	Date of stay: March 2018

Lovely views overlooking the ocean and the sea breeze was divine. Service is great and lots of choice as to where you sit - restaurant or bar service. Amusing to watch the squirrels running around in the blinds. I am always staggered when a 5 star hotel runs out of what you'd think was a basic item in this case samosas, especially in a country where you'd think that they could knock up a samosa in an instant but there you go.......... they ran out..... Didn't spoil the lunch but leaves an odd thought in your mind.... as to how is this so? Good value given location and well worth a visit."	Date of stay: February 2018

We loved the grandeur of this historical hotel, the buzz of activity in the common areas, and the cool artefacts they have kept from their most noteworthy guests. The atmosphere is certainly very special, and the warm service makes it even better.  Nonetheless, the rooms are quite tired at this point. We had to use one of those heavy, old-fashioned brass keys to open our room, and there is a huge fine attached if you lose it. So stressful - why not just replace with key cards?! Our room was quite dark as well, though it was large and had a balcony facing the hotel gardens and the sea beyond.  The location is prime, and it was easy to get to good restaurants and other sites around the center"	Date of stay: August 2017

This is an old colonial hotel, on the beach and with a nice terrace and lawn, on which to have a beer. There is also a cool verandah, which serves an excellent well priced buffet lunch. Recommended and close to port ( hotel will deliver you back there in their own wagons ) so ideal if on a shore visit from cruise ship."	Date of stay: February 2018

Unfortunately, off to your right the view is spoilt by wholesale land reclamation and works on Colombo port. My room was the Premier Ocean View Room with Balcony, but truth to tell you had to go out to the edge of the balcony, lean out and look left to see the ocean, thanks to the aforementioned reclamation works. The room itself was large and had high ceilings. The hardwood floors are lovely, but occasionally creak, and if you have active guests on the floor above (as we did) it can sound like an elephant stampede. A puzzle for me is why the hotel website lists this room as having one twin bed, when in fact it has two queen size beds.

Huge corridors, huge restaurant, people everywhere, slightly uncomfortable , bit staid and snooty, rooms laid out in old fashioned style etc.  The sea and pool are great but you can get better sea views all over the island so why spend a fortune and have the traffic noise day and night. 4 stars because if it’s your thing, you’ll love it - they’ve done the old style charm very well ."

Definitely one to add to the list of outstanding hotels in the world.   The decor throughout is stunning, the views to the ocean from all areas of the hotel are beautiful. The rooms are lovely and my room overlooking the ocean was perfect.   I feel as if I’m running out of superlatives but breakfast is amazing. There is such a wide range of delicious food from all over the world. The chef will also cook eggs to your preference. The smell of the Sri Lankan curries was sublime.

In spite of recent refurbishments, the rooms are still tired and dated in comparison to newer hotels.

Diane R	Superb Hotel	"We visited this hotel for coffee and snacks only. We sat on the terrace with views of the sea.Superb service, comfort and ambiance. It is a luxury hotel with all the facilities that you would expect in a hotel of this calibre. It has a small museum which has Prince Philip's first car on display. Prince Edward and his wife arrived whilst we were there."	Date of stay: January 2018
Christopher D	Colonial atmosphere and service at its best	"This hotel personifies colonialism. There are more luxurious hotels of this type in the Far East, but this hotel has no tower wing or new wing and remains true to its origin as a three storey colonial building on the edge of the Indian Ocean. Rooms are decorated accordingly but views vary tremendously depending where you are situated in the hotel. Try to get an ocean view if you can. Service is impeccable and could not be faulted. The terrace, restaurants, bars and swimming pool area are lovely and all worthy of mention. If you like big, modern and flash avoid this place, but if you want history, service, class and atmosphere then make it a priority to come here!"	Date of stay: February 2018

Soumya Sankar P	Nice stay	"Scenic views from the junior suite are great, not so however from the others though .. Food is decent & travel services are also good. Nice place to stay in Colombo.. Since hotel is near the Galle beach, an evening stroll in that area is within reach as well."	Date of stay: February 2018
Gavin H	They have worked hard in the refurbishments and they are charging accordingly.	I have stayed at the Galle Face many times over the last 20 years and it is lovely to see it thriving. The rooms are fabulous and given the constraints of the building and its proximity to the sea you couldn't want for more. The sea water pool is a beautiful place to start the day before breakfast and the checkerboard bar cannot be bettered for sundowner drinks. Many of the old wrinkles have been dealt with and this is now an out and out wonderful experience. The only issue is the price which has been hiked up so much that the experience just doesn't feel value for money.	Date of stay: February 2018

Peter V	Grand old lady of Colombo hotels	"This is the grand old lady of Colombo’s hotels, parts of it dating from the mid 19th century.  It has been meticulously maintained and is, judging by the fact that it was completely full, extremely popular.  The views include the sea, Galle Face Green, and the massive land reclamation project which will be Colombo Port City, a $15bn development funded by Chinese investors.  The location is perfect, even if we were woken by a marching band before 6 a.m on Sunday morning.  Colombo is a building site with new hotels and commercial skyscrapers in course of development everywhere.  There is a glorious seawater pool, great for swimmers but rather deep for children, and the main restaurant is on the open verandah.  Everything was buzzing at all times and the staff were kept extremely"	Date of stay: February 2018
Craig T	"A Great ""Soft Landing"""	"My wife and I have come to really enjoy a 'soft landing' after we've traveled half way around the world, meaning staying in a nice hotel at least for the first couple of days.  The Galle Face was a GREAT soft landing.  Right on the ocean, with nice views, comfortable rooms and tasty restaurants, we really enjoyed our two days here.The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms very good and the breakfast, although a bit pricey, was really good. In fact, famous people come here as we were told Prince Andrew was there at the same time.  Well, la di da!  I love the fact that the Galle Face has that colonial feel and the service is first class all the way.  The staff is wonderful and very helpful. Would stay here again anytime!"

Appreciated: - Staff are all kind and sincere. You can feel it as you see their warm smile. - Great location, full and beautiful sea view, close to several tourist attractions like the old parliament and the beach. - Historical building, colonial style, cannot find such sophisticated atmosphere in new hotels. - The restaurant named 1864 is great in terms of service, food quality and price. I've visited it twice during my stay. - The drivers provided by the hotel expedition department offer very good service. They speak good English and think for the best interest of passengers.

Cassie De Pecol	Disappointing Management	"Tha management of the hotel was just terrible and treated me poorly. Of the hundreds of luxury hotels I've stayed in around the world, traveling to 196 countries, this one was one of the worst. When you stay somewhere, it's expected that you're treated kindly by staff and management, but boy, what a let down. The rooms weren't great, I could hear loud noises and music all night long, which made for terrible nights sleep. The only positive thing about this place was the brunch buffet. Though there were tons of pigeons that the staff had to keep shooing away. If you're going to have pigeons at breakfast, better just move the buffet to indoors, am I right? But spare yourself and stay at the Taj or Hilton."	Date of stay: March 2017

LadyTeeee	The best start to our honeymoon!	"Very pretty colonial style hotel on the beach front in Colombo with a lovely bar you can sip Lion beer and listen to the waves. We stayed here for the first night of our honeymoon and the staff were fabulous! Friendly, professional and helpful they made our first night really special. We were give a free upgrade, cake, champagne and chocolates and couldn't have been made to feel any more welcome. We didn't have time to explore Colombo that much as we were off to Kandy on the early train the following morning. We ate at the Nuga Gama or Banyan Village a Sri Lankan buffet restaurant in the nearby Cinnamon hotel, brought to life around a 200-year-old Banyan tree, surrounded by wattle & daub huts and traditionally dressed staff. The 'village' that surrounds the buffet is artificial"	Date of stay: January 2018

Breakfast was second to none, with a vast array of delicious food."	Date of stay: January 2018

Rupert S	A throwback to the old British empire days	Excellent frontage and brilliant architecture but rooms were old and tired unfortunately. Breakfast was average at best. Service passable only. The beach front was very pleasant to walk though. If you're looking for a good night's sleep and no more then highly recommended. But a longer stay would be disappointing. Gets an average mark from me.	Date of stay: February 2018

Room was a bit small - but still adequate and well appointed. Excellent bed / pillows / shower.  Good a/c. Very good food and service.  Apart from all that, the Colonial ambience and great location (albeit with high-rises to the rear) make it a 'must stay'."	Date of stay: February 2018

The location is good, right next to the sea and not far from the city centre.  The food was both excellent and interestingly -  the cashew and pea curry impressed everyone who sampled it - and the choice at breakfast was equally impressive. The rooms were large, comfortable and very clean. We joined the afternoon tour of the hotel and found this informative and enjoyable.  I was sorry to leave and would be happy to go back for a longer stay."	Date of stay: February 2018

When we went to afternoon tea, staff wouldn’t  let us order at first. They said it was too late to order. We pointed out that it was 30 minutes left to order according to their website and then they told us we had to go to the pool bar. Well there we ordered in afternoon tea but we did not even get tea. The included did not say they. We had read about afternoon tea including champagne but neither was there.  It took a very long time to bring our tray with incisions and pastries.

louiseb130	A step back in time	"When I walked into the lobby of the Galle Face, I was delightfully surprised by its charm and stateliness. This 1864 British Colonial Era hotel is a jewel in Colombo. I stayed two nights and loved it. It's great to wander around the place and discover the library, other common sitting areas, and even Prince Phillip's first car (they have the actual car!).  The breakfast buffet was huge and had Sri Lankan foods as well as more Western breakfast fare.  I just happened to arrive on Sri Lankan Independence Day, and although my taxi driver had a hard time letting security let us enter, when I arrived I had a front row view of the parade. A great stay in a charming old place."	Date of stay: February 2018

CenturyLondon	Classic Colonial Style - a Delight	This hotel is so classically colonial the the Sri Lankan Post Office commemorated it on a recent postage stamp. This is a luxury property that allows one to slip back to the 19th century in great comfort. The Travelers Bar is a treat either inside or on the ocean view terrace. This must be one of the great colonial hotels of Asia. Highly recommended.	Date of stay: February 2018
June l	Very dissapointed	"After having changed the hotel recommended by our tour company to this one recommended by friends we were shocked mainly by the service in the buffet restaurant, The main problem was that we ordered drinks, initially I waited 10 minutes before anyone asked if I wanted to order anything, then when we did, it took maybe 15 minutes to bring an aperitif, then the white wine was brought warm, instead of changing it for a cold bottle we had to wait 1/2 whilst it sat in ice . The buffet looked better than it tasted. Then to bed our room was o.k but had no view at all, a tiny concrete bit with some shrubs on.only one desk chair to sit on, so no option but sit on the bed. The noise until 3.30 a.m was dreadful, people being loud and banging bedroom doors. Yes very smart hotel in a very"	Date of stay: February 2018

BookGirlNYC	Beautiful!	"My friend and I enjoyed a short but lovely stay at this beautiful property. Our room, a premier ocean view twin, was large, airy, and bright. The veranda was wide and had amazing views, although the crows sometimes scared us into staying indoors!   The pool is fantastic and the fruit treats were a hit. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the public spaces are nicely kept. We also had a fun time listening to the live cover band perform that Thursday evening, as we watched paper lanterns take to the sky. We also enjoyed a guided day trip to Kandy, etc., organized by the concierge.  Taxis are inexpensive to get around town. If you're traveling to/from the airport during rush hours, give yourself ample time.  If I'm ever back in Colombo, I hope to stay here once again!"	Date of stay: January 2018

Chris W	No longer luxurious hospitality this that this Grande Dame was one famous for.	"I have stayed many times over a good number of years at the Galle Face Hotel. I was revelry there for a 7 day stay, simply to enjoy the facilities and generous hospitality of this famous hotel.  Things are slipping, and there is no way you could describe the hospitality as generous. Take breakfast for example - Sparkling Wine was always served but no longer. 90% of the staff said ‘cost cutting’ the remains 10% said new alcohol rules! Strange how other top hotels in the immediate vicinity still serve a glass of bubbly at breakfast.   The buffet itself has also changed. Charcuterie, cheeses, smoked salmon now have to be requested, they are not available for selection from the buffet. Another example of cost cutting? Croquet, still advertised on the hotel website was also not"	Date of stay: January 2018

The hotel provides a unique combination of colonial grandeur and elegance and modern day luxury. It is in a very special location indeed with restaurants and gardens overlooking the Indian Ocean. One can sit on the terrace and enjoy the tremendous sunsets over the water. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served in the Verandah Restaurant which again has views to the sea. Other dining options are available including a formal restaurant and a pool bar. The buffets are very extensive with a good range of Eastern and Western dishes and a la carte meals are available if preferred.

Please do not miss this if you are in Colombo."	Date of stay: February 2018
Robin G	A wonderful place to stay before leaving Sri Lanka	"This is a beautiful large historic hotel (the oldest East of Suez) but it manages to deliver a personal touch due to the exceptional staff and probably the fact that it not part of a chain.  Its been brought up to date without ruining any of its unique atmosphere.  Its location on the sea front at Colombo is stunning and it takes advantage of it.  Our room was quite small but perfectly designed with a large balcony overlooking the sea with two loungers and a table and chairs for room service..  The food in the sea food restaurant was outstanding and breakfast a memorable experience.  The only downside was that we only had one night here, do stay for at least two."	Date of stay: January 2018

Love the traditional feel and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel."	Date of stay: January 2018

Add to this mix some of the best food, drink and exemplary discreet service and you have a great stay.

We stayed twice in the Galle Face during our 3 week stay in SriLanka and it was the best by far."	Date of stay: January 2018
Martin C	Going back with the wife	"The Galle Face hotel is one of the must see places in Sri Lanka. I visited the hotel some years back and always promised I would return with my wife so she could enjoy the experience. The hotel which is 150 years old is steeped in history and the hotel museum has to be on your to do list while you are there. There is so much to see and experience you don't really need to go anywhere else. Great staff, service and food with breathtaking views of the ocean."	Date of stay: January 2018

We especially enjoyed looking out over the sea whilst enjoying buffet meals by the chequerboard. The food was all delicious and there was a wide choice -- a Japanese buffet on the evening we were there. Staff take great pride in their work and everything runs like clockwork. It was a fantastic treat to stay at the Galle Face for our last night in Sri Lanka -- only wish it could have been longer!"	
dubstatik	Hugely disappointing.	"Was really looking forward to staying here again - I had fond memories of my stay several years ago. However on checking in I was told that the room (with double bed) I had booked over a month ago was not available. I was offered an ""upgrade"" - from Superior Queen to.... Superior Queen. That's some upgrade. I had to talk to a second (senior) member of staff at check-in for the mistake to finally be acknowledged, and was then offered a change of room - but only for the following day. I really feel I shouldn't have to argue with staff merely to have my original booking honoured. Very disappointing and a sour end to my holidays in Sri Lanka. I will not be using the Galle Face Hotel again."	Date of stay: January 2018

"We weren’t staying at the GFH but it had been recommended that afternoon tea and a sunset as seen from the Viranda was an experience not to be missed.   The recommendation was spot on, a most beautiful hotel, with a history of hosting and entertaining the worlds stars and ‘A’ list for the last 100+ years. With great service, even better tea, sandwiches, scones and cakes we spent a wonderful couple of hours taking tea and watching the sun go down, enjoying the atmosphere, service and views.   If you have the opportunity ( and like  afternoon tea) do make the time to do this - a most wonderful experience ( and very reasonable - less than £10 per head)"	Date of stay: January 2018

The hotel is very large but seems to have ample staff and eating places to meet this need. The pool area gets very crowded however, so it's difficult to find a lounger in the afternoon. Food at the pool bar was average, but the cocktail list is great and the drinks very very good. I tried a spa treatment in the newly opened loccitaine spa which was very good, if over priced compared to other places I had tried.

Our room was attractively furnished and the linens and towels were of high quality.  Our very large bed was super-comfortable, and our room was spotless.

Breakfast was good with an enormous selection of food.  The outdoor swimming pool you can actually really swim in and is sufficiently deep too. Great! We only stayed for one night, but should have stayed a couple more days. We felt at home!  One small remark: when we should up in a tuktuk the butler outside was a bit unsure whether we were guests. After we had unloaded our bags and had taken some pictures, we walked in with the bags ourselves and then the butler was quick to assist, although not really necessary.

floss c	Very disappointing for a 5* hotel	"Not 5* at all away from the public areas  We stayed in standard twin rooms in the very top corner of the hotel, apparently in the south wing but with no signs and no direction from hotel staff it took us 30 minutes to find our rooms. Rooms were very old fashioned and not in a quaint way. One room - 4006 - had problems with ants, noisy a/c and a shower that overflowed onto for bathroom floor so badly that there was thick black mould around the bath.   Staff were grumpy and very in-Sri Lankan in not being welcoming.   No information about what time bars closed (and fines changed depending on the person you asked) and we were only advised of the sun-down happy hour on our last day, being told when asked why we hadn’t been told that it wasn’t public!!   The spa was closed for"	Date of stay: January 2018
NLB101	Classic colonial style	"This is a gorgeous, typical Portuguese style building with all of the rooms facing an inner courtyard with a shaded and deep pool. The rooms are beautiful but the whole place needs to be freshened up - the finishes are tired and worn, doors don’t close properly, aircon is loud and inefficient, rugs are stained and surfaces are scuffed. The beauty of the building itself and the quality renovation in the 1990s means that these faults can be overlooked for the moment, however it didn’t feel like the hotel was being cared for and maintained by its current owners and that is a pity.   The service was attentive and staff were very helpful.   It was good to experience a place like this, but just like with the fort around it, one to two days is all you need. And after a few hours"	Date of stay: January 2018

Sandysamnmynic	Stay here!!!	"This is a charming historic building with large spacious rooms. We stayed on 2 individual nights and fell in love with the hotel. Coming home to this space is pure delight when sightseeing Colombo and it’s surrounds. There is so much attention to detail and the history adds that bit of extra appeal.  The sound of the ocean rolling in is like a lullaby at night. At sunset, bagpipes are played for the lowering of the flag at dusk -it’s a charming tradition to watch.  The breakfast buffet is the best I’ve had throughout India and Sri Lanka. High tea? Between 4-6.  Go to Galleface hotel and enjoy your stay!!"	Date of stay: January 2018
billobe1	Wonderful	"Full of charm and tradition this wonderful old hotel provides high quality service and attention to detail. Stayed here for almost 3 weeks on business and it is such a pleasant change from the modern sterile hotel chains that are found everywhere. Refurbished a couple of years ago the owners clearly resisted the opportunity to modernise instead opting to retain the well worn polished wooden floors and the various nooks and crannies such as the library and small museum that gives this place its charm. The museum has photos of the many famous figures who have stayed from politics, Hollywood, sport including Gandhi, Che Guevara, Vivien Leigh, the Duke of Edinburgh (they even have his first car) and many more.  Situated overlooking the ocean you have a lovely breakfast buffet with a"	Date of stay: January 2018
1234emma	Charming hotel.	"Stayed for four nights. Hotel charming, service good, pool brilliant, it’s saltwater and very deep. It’s not an ideal pool for small children, there’s a big drop over the low wall onto the beach. The bar at the side has a happy hour and live music! The piper plays the bagpipes whilst the flag is lowered each night.The hotel gets very busy at this time with people coming in for a drink. The spa is being refurbished at the moment. The carpet on the landings of floor one and two is old, worn and dirty. Lots of flys when eating in outside buffet.  Hotel minibus to airport approx £35 for six of us. At 7.00 am it took 45 minutes."

Stan C	Raffles Experience in Colombo - Great for Sunsets and a Cocktail	The Galle Face Hotel has a wide range of attractions and is the grande dame of the Colombo scene. It was opened in 1864 and has many of the features from that era such as large bars and tiled floors. There are a number of bars and restaurants as part of the complex ranging from buffets to more specialised places on the beach and the dining room.

Graham Y	Disgusting	"We stayed at the hotel 29th December to 1st January.  Although initially the view and atmosphere was ruined due to construction, we had no idea our experience would be further ruined by the private New Years Eve function that overtook the hotel. This was accurately described in the review “No Thanks” on 8th January. We fully support every detail they wrote as it was as disgusting as it sounds.   All paying hotel guests were treated as second rate. We were shunted to a the ball room for an overpriced mediocre New Years Eve function (US$150 a head not including drinks), exposed to a low-life night club environment that used the rest of the hotel facilities, and had no ability to get any sleep overnight (something that should be a given from an expensive hotel).

Kelly C	Beautiful colonial hotel with a sense of history	The hotel has a real sense of history and for travellers arriving at 3am the ginger welcome drink and kind staff were lovely. The old balcony was a beautiful setting for the buffet breakfast (which the kids thought was awesome - a great mix of western and local to keep everyone happy).  The rooms were clean and well maintained and the little room on the first floor with Prince Phillipa's first car a real history treasure trove. Lovely stay!	Date of stay: January 2018

Gayle A	One of the best hotels I have stayed at!	"This is a real treat. The Colonial feeling, the beautiful setting, ceiling fans in the breakfast terrace with infinity sea views. It is awe inspiring. I recommend it to anyone visiting Colombo. The feel good factor of swimming in the salt water pool before taking a sun lounger on the deck is unbelievably decadent. Windy ocean breeze laps around the Pool Bar. The staff at the pool bar are Exceptional. I have visited three times, twice with my little boy. The pool bar staff give out free ice cream to the kids. The Sri Lankan people definitely dote on young children. It is the same at the buffet on the veranda. Rooms are huge, even if it is a standard room. The balcony rooms are huge and very special with ocean views. Cannot fault it. Also champagne on offer at breakfast. What"	Date of stay: August 2017
Saffron S	"Elegant, historic and luxurious"	"Growing up in Colombo, I used to frequent the Galle Face Hotel for weddings, swimming and social teas. I've always had fond memories of this iconic hotel.  So we spent our first 3 days in Colombo at this hotel.  We enjoyed every aspect of this hotel, from the wonderful food, service, the incredible pool and the memorable Sri Lankan style.  It oozes charm and colonial classiness.  The room we had was basic, but we had the seaview, which made it worthwhile.  As for food, we really enjoyed the breakfast buffets and had high tea a few times.  The seafood restaurant is incredible.  Looking forward to our next trip!"	Date of stay: December 2017

Miriam B	"Beautiful historic hotel, but in need of upgrades."	"The Galle Face Hotel is rich in history and has a beautiful Ocean front location. We were delighted with the 180 view over the Indian Ocean and spectacular sunsets. Our simple double room, however, was in need of an upgrade and the some common areas also felt shabby and dusty. I understand the hotel is being in part renovated, so this may change. The rooms felt dark and lacking in decor, with oddly functioning commands and a noisy air conditioner vent. The sound proofing was also rather abysmal and we could hear conversations down the hallway and in the room next door to us. The pool area is also in need of an upgrade. The room service and pool-side restaurant/bar lacked in food options and suffered from poor service. We were disappointed with the lack of turn-down service - a"	Date of stay: December 2017
MichaelVC_7	No Thanks	"This, now privately-owned and over-priced hotel is living off the glory of a bygone era. It is presented as 5 Star but the experience is that of a 3 Star establishment. At a guess, the room we were provided has not been upgraded for at least three to four decades. Discoloured bathroom tiles especially in the shower, made it appear dirty and intermittent water flow in the shower was irritating.  Beyond this, four days out of a ten-day stay (23 Dec 2017 to 2 Jan 2018) was badly affected by the owner/manager’s decision to turn over the grounds of the hotel over to an entertainment provider for a New Year’s Eve techno/disco party for 2000 party goers. A single level scaffolding-supported floor was laid over aporox one and a half acres of paved and grassed areas and we were treated"	Date of stay: December 2017
leah w	An afternoon cocktail and walk through probably would’ve sufficed	"The hotel it self is quite beautiful and the historic aspect is top notch. But we definitely had some issues. We arranged car service to the airport and the driver had to take nearly a 30 minute detour to stop for gas which you don’t expect ever let alone at a so called 5 star hotel. We bought drinks at the pool bar and they said they’d deliver them to our seats. After waiting around 20 minutes my husband went back to the bar to ask where they were and they had forgotten to make them. Mind you that there were less than 25 people at the pool/pool bar. Also per their website our room included access to the long room, and when we went to enjoy a cocktail they said it wasn’t. After having to go back to the front desk show them their website they then “allowed” us to have access."	Date of stay: January 2018
MadeInFlorida	Should be #1 in Colombo	"If what you like in a hotel is an experience that can't be matched, this is the one.  A true heritage hotel with history in every corner.  Yet, it is exquisitely updated and maintained.  A location unmatched by any other -- right next to the sea -- we heard waves crashing all night, so soothing.  The hotel made our last night in Sri Lanka.  Fabulous service, an excellent fresh seafood restaurant with candlelight tables by the sea, and a turn of the century bar with plaques of all kinds of famous people that stayed there.  Give me this over any new hotel any day -- this is an experience.  My whole family, even our college kids, agreed that we all wanted to stay a whole week here."	Date of stay: December 2017

RomanovTraveller	Great History but needs to focus on the future	"This ‘colonial’ hotel looks good superficially. We stayed over Christmas and were treated to a rather extortionate hike in Room pricing which to be fair included the Christmas Eve buffet. The buffet looked impressive but if the truth be told, the food was actually quite mediocre. The rooms are dated and in fact the entire hotel needs a revamp. Our room smelt as they have drainage issues. We were upgraded thanks to the speedy intervention of Imran Ariff who is the Rooms Division Manager. He dealt with all issues very efficiently and politely. He is a Galle Face asset. Unfortunately this does not change the fact that Galle Face does not fulfill customer expectations bearing in mind the price and the brand.

Reasonable prices too - Location - easy walk to fort/ tuk tuk to fort only 100 rupees (ensure they’re metered) - Free mostly reliable wifi - Complimentary mini bar in room  The negatives-  - the snails pace at which everything moves. You never get anything the first time you ask for it! From check in, to menus and drinks, bookings, requests for information etc - Meals always arrived tepid - Housekeeping calling in every morning at 8:30am!!!

travelwearyLondon	Fabulous!	"This is a charming historic hotel set right by the sea in Colombo.  We loved just about everything from the amazing breakfast buffet to the lovely pool and the beautifully cleaned rooms.  We paid a little extra to have a sea view and balcony and it was well worth it.  There were a lot of weddings going on during our time there and it was great to see the traditional dancers.  Just occasionally, the location of the ceremonies meant that we had to go a long way round to get to where we wanted.  We were surprised that alcohol was not served on Christmas Day(although it was available on room service).  I think this is a custom which should be reviewed.  We certainly chose to go elsewhere where we could enjoy a glass of wine with  special dinner."	Date of stay: December 2017

Steve H	Wonderful old hotel	The whole family lived this historic old hotel (2 kids under 10). Booked online through a comparison site which allowed us to book a single room with one double bed for the whole family (?!?) We paid an upgrade to a junior suite and had an additional bed brought in - I was still happy with the overall value after the additional fees charged to do this.  Staff were very friendly and helpful. Kids loved the pool and buffet breakfast.   Very enjoyable stay overall and a great start to a Sri Lanka holiday.  It may lack some of the facilities of a modern 5* chain but I'd choose this in preference for its charm every time.   If I ever go back to Colombo I will stay here again.	Date of stay: December 2017

Since we were a family group we had three rooms and can vouch for the fact that they do vary significantly. The best have terrific views overlooking the ocean and poo,l while others have less impressive outlooks: to some extent you pay for what get, of course. Our suite was particularly nice - but I thought it disappointing that on the second night there was neither a turn-down service nor did the morning newspaper turn up. Not a sign of a well run hotel? However, we were all impressed by the breakfast buffet - great variety and constantly replenished to keep up with a very full hotel in the run up to Christmas. We also ate at the seafood restaurant - thought the staff and ambience was great but"	Date of stay: December 2017
Clara L	Unimpressed	"On entering this hotel, we knew it would not be a fantastic stay. Staff took a long time to check us in and when we got to the room it was a disappointment. Considering the hotel wasn’t busy, they put us in a dingy room with a view of the roof opposite. We even asked if there were any rooms with a better view and the reception never got back to us. The bed and bedroom are very small and gloomy. The staff are not particularly helpful and we were informed that the gym and spa were under renovation when we went to book a massage. There seems to be construction all over the hotel which makes a lot of noise throughout the day. Overall I would not recommend staying at this hotel and would never come again."

Most of the other high end hotels are across the street and have a large grassy field between them and the Ocean, Galle Face is right on it which is great for dinner/drinks and the pool. The staff was great and even gave me an upgrade of some kind to a really nice suite as one was available and I was a returning guest. Colombo is kind of a starting point in Sri Lanka (recommend 2 days), great to stay at a nice comfortable hotel with a lot of history to it and enjoy some time by the pool after a day seeing the city.

Being wedding season combined with New Year preparations we sometimes felt that guests comfort came second.With wedding staging and construction for new Year’s night it was actually tricky trying to get to certain parts of the hotel. Despite these inconveniences we would still return as this hotel has so much charm. So many famous people have stayed here and you can see a photo display  in the bar.

mbloggs	A shocker	"We had the misfortune to book here over New Years Eve where the hotel rented out their entire garden premises to a corporate group for a party of about 500 people. They had a full music festival stage, lights and amplification set up for the DJ. We had suite rooms that overlook the garden and were all but in the middle of this event. There is absolutely no noise insulation in these old rooms with balcony doors that barely close properly and thin panes of glass in the windows. And this party went on all night. When we rang reception at 4am to ask when it might stop, they told us the whole hotel was noisy so there was little point in complaining and that the party would go until about 7.30am. The noise was so intense that our windows and doors were rattling from the reverberation."	Date of stay: December 2017

We booked Premier Sea View rooms with the website promising balconies and views of the ocean. Unfortunately, this hotel does not deliver. Our rooms overlooked the front drive and carpark and the ‘view’ was the partial view of the sea dredging going on in the distance.

Knowing that people such as Emperor Hirohito, D. H Lawrence, Che Guevara and Don Bradman had walked the same halls really reinforced the genuine heritage this hotel has. The vaulted ceilings, timber staircases and open air verandah were straight from a Rupyard Kipling novel.

We had booked an above average room and were happy with the one we were given being spacious and with a double aspect.

The breezes on the big verandahs and the ocean views and the attentive staff were lovely. Watching the sunset from the colonial verandahs and from our room was really spectacular. Our kids played on the green lawn and enjoyed the pool and ate French fries happily while we enjoyed our drinks.  Sunset offers a free Cocktail hour and the staff played frisbee with our kids for a bit.  Yes outside on the green beside the hotel is dodgy but the feeling of stepping back in time for two days really got the imagination going and inspired some reading on Sri Lanka’s path to independence.

All very eager to please and always willing to ensure our every need is met. Would definitely recommend this hotel as you are guaranteed a 5 star service on all levels. Mr  Kumar Nanayakkara (restaurant manager) personally overlooked our food requirements as we are strict vegetarians. A big thank you to everyone for the hospitality received. Not only is the welcome amazing, the hotel itself is very beautiful and relaxing."	Date of stay: December 2017

Mala B	Memorable stay	This was our first stay at the Galle Face Hotel and it turned out to be a wonderful experience.The hotel itself is a heritage hotel and has a unique character of its own.We had a large and comfortable room with a view of the ocean.It was exhilarating to wake up to the sound of the waves dashing against the shore.Breakfast had a very wide range of choices even for vegetarians and the service was excellent.Would look forward to staying here again	Date of stay: November 2017

Leopard_Lil	Perfectly located by the ocean	"I didn't stay at the Galle Face on my recent two trips to Colombo, but I visited the Traveller's Bar on the ground floor on three occasions and worked my way through the cocktail menu.  Whether inside or out, the atmosphere is grand and colonial and you feel like you have traveled back in time to a less hurried era,  Sitting outside with the shutters pulled down and the sea crashing in the midst of a rain shower is a wonderful place to be, especially with a cheeky squirrel darting in and out of the rafters.  Not only are the cocktails delicious but the nibbly bits are worth returning for.  They are some kind of home-made potato crisp, only possibly not made of potato, and doused in a spikey mix of who knows what spices.  Ridiculously more-ish.  Bar snacks are available too and I"	Date of stay: December 2017
dvr2020	Racist hotel	Beware if you are Indians don't try this Racist hotel. On 30th Nov one of my business partner took me to this hotel for dinner on the sea side restaurant. we walked almost 1 km from Kingsbury hotel and reached this place by 8 pm. when we try for a table on the sea side the restaurant guys keep on telling every table is reserved. There are hardly 2-3 tables occupied and almost 8-10 tables are vacant but they insist all are reserved. Then we understand they don't want coloured people they want to cater only the whites.Still the colonial mind set has not gone in this place even after independent from British long ago. we did a mistake by selecting this place in the first place.

Also in the close proximity of shopping outlets like TFO(The Factory Outlet),the famous outlet for bargain shopping at Havelock Road less than 5 kms away,while Barefoot on Galle Road for finest crafts just 2.7 kms and ODEL at Alexendra Place,the one stop shop just 2 kms from the hotel.

SLtraveller	"Review on the Pool Bar ,  Same food that rotates from one to another"	"Hotel is  grandeur  and it is a unique landmark in Colombo  and pride itself for its long standing history . Though I enjoy this hotel very much ( regular visitor ) , my experience yesterday at the Pool Bar is extremely disappointing .   Ordered some drinks ( fresh juice and mocktails no alcohol due to Poya day  ) and grilled chicken along with some other dishes . For my surprise the side salad that comes with the chicken was withered and dried that seemed it had been lying in the hot sun for hours . There was nothing fresh about it and it was awful to eat and I noticed it only after eating one or two bites in to it .    Avoid eating the garnish of your drinks because that is something being rotated from one guest to another ( in case it is not eaten ) .I  walked to the counter"	Date of stay: December 2017
akinarih2017	Good ambience	"The hotel location is great, in front of the beach.  But my rooms on my first and second stays were on the other side of the building.  My room at my initial stay was old:  lights were dim, water pressure was weak, a crack on the floor.  On my second stay my room was upgraded to junior suite, which was much more comfortable: both lights and water were fine, room was cleaner."	Date of stay: December 2017
Sajith W	Great wedding location	It seems to be a great wedding location.  The hotel was recently fully refurbished and the ball room looks really nice. The food was tasty but slightly expensive. Once the music is played you feel the vibration on the floor and it can be irritating. The appearance of the ball room is super nice and can accommodate larger gatherings.  Enough space for parking and vale parking is also available	Date of stay: December 2017

JA_Gorman	Lovely hotel but ruined by noisy neighbours	"The hotel itself is stunning, lovely staff greeted us and the room we had was amazing, just what we needed for our last night in Sri Lanka before the long flight home.  Here's the problem though. We stayed in Colombo our first night and last night. On our first night (different hotel) we had to move rooms at 4am due to neighbours partying etc and once again we were woken up at approx 2am by returning people insisting on playing loud music. We had to call reception twice, but they were still playing music at 5am when we had to get up anyway to get ready for the airport. I don't know if this is a regular thing in Colombo, if young people descend on the hotels at the weekend to party?  It was a bit frustrating for our last night of luxury."	Date of stay: December 2017

Kobus N	A special place with very special people	Our 6-day stay at this hotel was one of the best hotel-experiences we have had in the past 10 years. The staff were more than 100% friendly and helpful--you experience a kindness which is very rare these days. The facilities were excellent---a large number of restaurants to choose from; each unique and different. Shops and a shopping mall is a short walking distance and most of the sightseeing attractions are easily reachable. The old-style ambience made this hotel even more attractive.

WeLeaveToday	Good for a Short Stay; Best Location in Colombo	"We chose to stay at the Galle Face Hotel as part of a 1.5 day trip to Colombo due to its location and the history of the hotel and booked Premier Ocean Balcony room.  The Room:  Overall the room was nice, clean and comfortable. There is a mini fridge int he room with water, soft drinks and snacks which was appreciated since we arrived at 01:30 and were hungry and thirsty. We really did enjoy the balcony and the view of the property and ocean and so we'd recommend booking this type of room as the other rooms do appear to be missing natural light. The room smelled slightly musty when we turned the air conditioning on but know to expect it when staying in buildings this old.

Last night, Management booked a weeding at the hotel which, I now understand, is done frequently.  Due to the noise, sleep was not an option until well past midnight last night.   It is like staying in a youth hostel above a bad nightclub.  And surprise,  there is another wedding tonight!     Galle Face is a nice property, but is wildly overpriced for the quality of the rooms.  It is an old hotel which can be charming, but in this case equals small, unremarkable, noisy rooms, mediocre bedding, no gym (at the moment), and unresponsive a.c.. Galle Face is like a vintage car—it looks cool, but performs poorly.    I stay 75-90 nights per year in hotels.   This was my worst hotel experience"	Date of stay: November 2017

I stayed in this great hotel once during my official trip to Colombo and enjoyed the food and stay in this historical hotel very much. It’s located at Galle Face Road in Colombo and adjacent to popular Galle Face Green area. This time, I stayed with my family in the Cinnamon Grand hotel on the same road near by the property. We decided to have buffet lunch in the hotel at the Verandah to enjoy the food as well as to observe the spectacular view of the great Indian Ocean from the Verandah. The food was excellent with many choices and my family absolutely love the excellent food and services along with the great atmosphere. We had great time there, our children"	Date of stay: September 2017
16outandover	One of a handful of the world's most distinctive historic hotels	"If you appreciate historic hotels, the Galle Face is the place for you.  Enjoying pride of place on the Colombo waterfront since the 1860s, the hotel has in recent years been thoughtfully restored.  The period character is intact without feeling embalmed or kitschy.  The Galle Face benefits from its seaside location, and rooms at the front of the hotel are treated to the mesmerizing sound of crashing waves. The back of the property faces a busy street, and is subject to traffic noise.  Because this is a vintage facility, the rooms are not of uniform size or design - I've stayed several times over the past twenty years, and the rooms vary in size and layout.  When booking, check what's available and make your preferences clear.  Rooms are extremely comfortable, and have"	Date of stay: November 2017

Jennifer S	Interesting Hotel	"We stayed here for two nights at the end of our three week holiday,it is situated in a prime position on the green and overlooking the ocean. On arrival the room I was allocated was small claustrophobic and had a very poor view when I said I wasn’t happy the reception staff quickly offered me another room which was acceptable. Because this is a big hotel the service is good but impersonal some staff smiled a lot others didn’t smile at all. I found the history of this hotel interesting and I am glad we stayed here but not sure that I would return. It was nice to be able to stroll along the waterfront early evening and watch local family’s enjoying themselves in the water it’s a lively area at sunset."	Date of stay: November 2017
JohnnyBerkshire_	Colonial bar experience	"Unfortunately we didn't stay at the hotel but we did visit the main bar area, sitting outside so we could see the ocean. It was a lovely way to finish our two nights in Colombo and was a perfect antidote to the rough and loud nature of the rest of the capital. Drinks were on the pricey side but quality of the drinks and the ambiance made up for it."	Date of stay: October 2017

Nofibbin	Seen better days!	"Situated on the sea (there are no sandy beaches) this old dump is resting on on its laurels.  We had a ‘premium’ suite that wreaked of sewer gas.  The constant honking from the adjacent traffic circle left us sleepless.  Their spa was under renovation, wished they had told us before we booked, their fine dining restaurant 1864 had surly service, their bar our only solace.  An expensive way to waste our vacation."

coconutbay153	Wonderful luxury.	"Galle Face hotel in Colombo is a true gem from colonial times. The location , the lobby, the rooms in the old wing and new wing are all splendid. Although the Hotel was built way back in 1864, the extensions and refurbishments over the years have been executed flawlessly. The buffet breakfast is definitely worth it . Staff and service are very good, although the service staff behind the egg counters could be more friendly. The overall experience is worth the money and highly recommended."

Our first room was in the old part of the hotel and immediately above the function room where a wedding was going full pelt.  After speaking with the front desk we were moved several floors higher into a massive attic room that felt like Miss Haversham would pop out at any minute.  Great, great hotel for ambiance and atmosphere.  Fabulous breakfast buffet with literally anything and everything you could ever want on offer.  It really felt like we'd stepped back in time.  Hot & cold running staff, simple old fashioned enormous bathroom, huge room.  Definitely a great place to at least visit if you're in Colombo"	Date of stay: December 2016

Oodles of atmosphere and service that harks of a bygone era.  The Chief concierge Emmanuel and his assistant Imran(??) not sure I spelled this right, were extremely helpful. Because we were a party of 5 we couldn't just hop in a tuktuk and go. The hotel arranged for a car and driver with the patience of a saint to take us around to the various areas where we wanted to go. The price was extremely reasonable  and we did not drive him crazy with our demands.

I was therefore a bit anxious as I returned after some years, with my husband (he visited for the first time). More renovation had been done, but the ""essence"" of the hotel was still there. In fact we were upgraded, and had a very comfortable stay. The restaurants are still great. When I visit Colombo again I will stay here again."	Date of stay: October 2017
Ghazal S	Good hotel	"Galle Face is a very old heritage hotel with palatial colonial styled rooms. They were huge and very comfortable. The only issues though were that there were tiny bugs in the bathroom. Maybe because it was old and I can imagine it not going down well with most people.  The veranda where breakfast is served is open and since the temperature in Colombo is hot and humid, maybe it should be covered and air-conditioned."	Date of stay: April 2017
Katie D	The site photos don't match the hotel	"With only two nights in Colombo I wanted a wonderful hotel and looked at a lot of sites. Yes, the Galle Face is “historic” but it turns out that is also a euphemism for rundown.   That said, if all the other issues we experienced hadn’t existed, we would’ve ignored the very small room, the bathroom door that didn’t open all the way (making it hard to get to “my” side of the sink), and the honking cars and whistling trains at very early hours. I wouldn’t have spent time writing this. But I don’t want someone else to waste any precious vacation time, so here you go.   The thing that irritates us the most was the less-than-helpful staff, and that just exacerbated all the other “less thans.”  Having just come from a beach week at Mirihi resort in Maldives, I wanted to go to a nail"	Date of stay: October 2017

I upgraded the room to junior suite as needed an extra bed, the superior room is small no space after adding an additional bed, the term superior is misleading. I suggest changing the name.   The rooms have wooden floors and creek a lot, however they are neat & clean.   Their fish restaurant is excellent must try , however its expensive.   The breakfast was good with a lot of variety.

However, we had a room above the grand ballroom which had functions on pretty much constantly during our stay.  During the day and into the late night there was constant loud noise including, drumming, disco music and speeches through a loud microphone.  This really did leave us exhausted by the fourth night as we were sleep deprived.   Our room also did not have a balcony but our window looked out onto the balcony of an adjacent room.

The cosy bar has a feel of a gentleman's club and has many photographs on the walls of the celebrities who have stayed there including heads of state, royalty, film stars and sports personalities.

The elevator was upto the 3rd floor after which we had to walk up a flight of stairs. The room was gorgeous! We could hear the ocean all night long. Bed was very comfortable too. Being a decor enthusiast, I loved everything about the room from the plump cushions, ornate bedside lamp, the beautiful carpet, the bathroom fittings. I could go on and on.

The hotel has everything you need, room service, restaurant choices, great  toiletries, gym (closed when we were there, guests were given another gym option next door), LARGE breakfast buffet, butler service etc. Location is great. With that being said...  Even though it's an old building it should be better kept being a 5 star hotel and all. Both rooms and common areas feel a bit run down. Extremely damp, especially in the rooms. AC and fans doesn't help at all. Service is acceptable but very impersonal. In fact the whole hotel experience is impersonal (good but not great service, food, ambiance). Wouldn't recommend it"	Date of stay: October 2017

Although it is located in a central part of the city and on the ocean, stepping in through its doors is like walking into a resort. It has the country's only saltwater swimming pool, several bars and restaurants, and even a museum showing the hotel's long history and many famous guests (think royalty and celebrities for decades). Rooms are large and comfortable, and have a minibar where everything is included in the rate, so enjoy it without worry.

This hotel has been renovated but certain things are very difficult to incorporate in an old building. Large rooms and spacious bathrooms but old style bath fittings and commodes. buffet section is good but food ordered in the room was horrible. We were  pasta which was sweet and smelly. Other than that everything was good except for no balconies in the rooms. Mini bar is free without liquor. Hotel is centrally located on the beach with proximity to casino and other joints. wifi is good. staff very courteous.	Date of stay: October 2017
Rowan B	"A beautiful, colonial-style hotel and an oasis from the bustle of Colombo"	"We had a fantastic few days at the historic Galle Face Hotel - a blast from the colonial past of Ceylon.  The Galle Face is a must-stay place in Colombo.  The service was fantastic, rooms were beautiful and the sea-side location was an amazing place to see the sun set - complete with a local wearing a kilt and playing the bag-pipes each evening when they lower the flag at sunset.  Possibly the best part of Galle Face is the food.  Their buffet breakfast overlooking the sea was simply fantastic each morning.  Even better was the freshly cooked seafood at the restaurant each evening.  Highly recommended."	Date of stay: October 2017
Sanjeewa007	Old Charm	GFS one of the oldest hotels is looking very smart and luxurious after its extensive refurbishment. The 1864 resturant is one of the best Romantic places in Colombo for fine dining. The hotel as a nice sea view and the Galle Face Green. The outdoor restaurants and high tea is very popular among the locals as well.	Date of stay: October 2017
Fifty-fifth	"OK - could have been a lot worse, could have been a lot better"	"I've been thinking a while about what to write in this review to give a fair picture of our time there.  We booked a Superior Room but certainly should have looked more carefully as that's basically the bottom-of-the-range at the Galle-Face – rather like coffee-shops or soap-powder-packets that go from Large, Extra-large and Enormous.   The hotel advert talked about a view of the sea (and we mentioned in our comments with our booking that's what we anted) but we had a view of the roof of the building right next door to us and were told no other Superior Rooms with a better view was available.  We also had a steady-stream of support staff coming in to provide us with a second bedside-lamp, take away the standard-lamp they brought and come back with a bed-side lamp, get the"	Date of stay: October 2017
estarman	"Lovely, elegant, friendly and atmospheric, wouldn't try anywhere else"	"Stayed at Galle Face for my first visit to Colombo / Sri Lanka. Found the hotel to be very charming and atmospheric. Service was friendly and effective but not overbearing. The rooms were a concern, because some previous reviewers mentioned that only one of the wings had been recently renovated. I called in advance to check that my room would be one of the ""new"" ones and the person on the phone mentioned that actually all rooms had now been renovated. I was certainly satisfied with my room's standards (size, decor, cleanliness). The breakfast at the verandah was always something to look forward to (although a bit hot), and the 30 m salt lap pool was quite enjoyable. Would recommend to anyone and would certainly like to return, whenever back in Colombo."	Date of stay: October 2017

hdias	Elegant colonial hotel	The Galle Face Hotel has been progressively returned to its former glory. It has the only salt water swimming pool in Colombo and is a great place to watch the sunset being located adjacent to the ocean.  Many historic people have stayed at this iconic hotel and sat on the famous verandah. We dined in the main Verandah restaurant but found it disappointing. You can get much better food and service elsewhere in Colombo.	Date of stay: October 2017
ijhodgson	"Interesting, atmospheric hotel to experience perhaps once in your life"	"So, stayed here for 6 nights some meetings. It's an attractive, interesting place, colonial and historic with multiple photos dotted around of famous people who stayed here.The complex is huge and includes a library, numerous meeting rooms, and places to eat (not all open at the same time). Staff were generally friendly, though check in can be slow (it seems always to be busy, especially at weekends). Payment is odd - when booked through their website it implies you've paid in advance (to get a 'good deal'), but on checking out I was asked to pay the full sum (which HADN'T apparently been taken in advance). Weird.   Rooms are clean and spacious - some with sea views - and the wi-fi reasonably quick (though it's open access so I'd recommend using a VPN for security). There's a"	Date of stay: October 2017
Alison L	Good place to stay	"We stayed here on our last night in Sri Lanka.  Very handy for the airport and central to where we wanted to be,.  The hotel  lobby and restaurant lovely but our room was tired and very small.  The bathroom needed updating but had all it needed.    We felt a little let down with the room, however we still enjoyed our stay.  Staff very attentive and polite, and helpful.     the hotel itself now feels dwarfed and shadowed by the massive amount of giant buildings going up around it, but I guess that's progression .  We loved Galle face green and the atmosphere there, with tourists and locals mixing and enjoying the sea and the kites!!   The sunset on the terrace of the hotel , with cocktail in hand was absolutely worth it!"	Date of stay: September 2017
Edizz2000	Indulge!	"We stayed here for our first part of our Sri Lankan trip as a treat for ourselves. And what a treat it turned out to be! The service, the food and the drinks were all amazing, and we couldnt fault anything.   The buffet breakfast was outstanding and included Sri Lankan and western options.   The staff were very attentive, with a special note going to the pool staff who went above and beyond - even noticing that my partner was doing a few laps and came over with bottles of water in an esky for when he got out!   Worth getting one of the ocean facing rooms and the green across the road is a good chance to mix with the locals and get amongst it!"	Date of stay: October 2017
Bozo C	Five Star Joke	"We booked the Gall Face Hotel as our last stay in an incredible holiday in Sri Lanka. What a mistake! On our arrival we asked if they could match the latest Booking.com price as we booked in July and our rate was quite a bit more expensive and did not include breakfast. after a long conversation with management nothing happened but we were told that we could have breakfast but would have to pay at checkout, hummm.  our room was supposed to be an upgrade which was an absolute joke. on the Saturday there was a wedding which started in the early afternoon with a disco which was directly under our room, our room was vibrating with the noise, so we left our room mentioned it as we left the hotel for some peace. We returned around 6pm went and had a G&T plus cheese platter, very nice,"	Date of stay: September 2017
ThreeApolTravellers	Doesn't live up to the hype	"We've had such a great 2 weeks in Sri Lanka, so it was unfortunate that it finished off at this hotel.  The hotel is nice enough - clean, spacious and beautiful. The staff were attentive and provided good service. The food was average and the buffet looked impressive but wasn't anything memorable.  Sadly our ""upgraded"" room we were allocated was street facing (not ocean/beach facing) - which we didn't mind. However, throughout our stay there we could smell the fumes from the traffic below. We regret not mentioning it to the hotel but honestly couldn't be bothered for a one-night stay and especially, as we were too tired to face having to move rooms.   If I had to go back, I would definitely request for an ocean-facing room and hope that the windows are sealed properly."	Date of stay: July 2017

Watch out for the touts that hang around the building - they ALL have the ""best things for you""."	Date of stay: October 2017
Aleta G	Unfortunate end to a lovely stay	"While this hotel is a historic treasure, our last night we were plagued by very loud music from the hotel courtyard to the extent that we could not hear our television let alone sleep. It boomed on until after 9 pm. It really colored our entire stay which until that point had been exceptional.   I don't think it is too much to ask that one could sleep or relax after 9 pm in your own hotel room, especially one commanding a price like the one charged."	Date of stay: October 2017
Katels85	Luxe1	"Stayed here for my final night in Sri Lanka and I'm so glad I splurged for it (lets just say the hotel my tour finished was at the opposite end of the scale to this one!) The hotel & grounds are beautiful and I was offered a room upgrade which was nice - until later that night when I discovered it was directly above the ballroom with the wedding going on - hoepfully managment will look into properly soundproofing the function room in its next lot of revamps as 3 floors up my entire room was vibrating, BUT it stopped promptly at 11.30pm and being a saturday night I just went out and enjoyed the hotel grounds again. I wasn't lucky enough to score a room with an ocean view, but I wasn't really in my room enough to enjoy it anyway - that's what sun loungers are for!  Had a few meals"	Date of stay: October 2017

All the staff throughout our stay were extremely friendly and helpful, they offered us a room upgrade however unfortunately there was a loud wedding going on below the suite we were offered so we stuck with our original room booking of a superior room. The room was large and comfortable anyway and had a great bathroom, complete with the comforts of bathrobes and nice toiletries. The Galle Face is a spectacular colonial building in a lovely setting on the waterfront. We had dinner at the Seaspray restaurant, which was superb and reasonably priced and enjoyed well made cocktails in the relaxing atmosphere of the Travellers"	Date of stay: August 2017

TravelEnthu_8	Royalty	"This place is one of the best in Sri Lanka. On check-in, we were greeted by a very friendly person, who made the whole process very easy. She also upgraded us to suites which was totally the grand finale of our trip.  The suite was ultra spacious with a huge room, study and mini kitchenette plus an oh-so-luxurious bathroom! And the location of the hotel! No words. Ocean on any side you look. From the rooms, from the bar, from the breakfast buffet! And then there is the famous Galle Face beach. It was the most happening scene and kids had fun flying kites and we were thrilled just soaking in the atmosphere. This is apparently the second oldest hotel in Colombo and they also had some souvenirs from the olden days on display.   All in all, great place.

So I finally braved enough and booked a stay during my last mission. Needless to say my DSA doesn’t cover the daily rate in this hotel but who cares. Got a room with almost full ocean view (if you do not mind cranes close by on the construction site for a new port). Room is nice , unless you prefer modern aluminium style interior, bathroom is really nice but the best things for me included location (the only sea front hotel), friendly staff, the swimming pool by the beach and breakfast buffet. If I save enough money I will visit again."	Date of stay: September 2017
MMB1954	Very comforatble	"Stayed for two nights on a ten day visit to Sri Lanka. Beautiful old colonial style building located on the side of the ocean. We were upgraded to a huge suite at the top of the building which was very nice and comfortable. The hotel has obviously been refurbished in recent years one overall was in good condition although the additional lift to our floor didn’t work. The staff were all very nice, willing to assist and very polite and always had a smile on their faces. Breakfast was OK and in a nice open lounge on the ocean side. We didn’t eat any other meals there so cannot comment on the overall food. A nice experience but small details like nowhere to hang bath towels etc in the bathroom are just slightly annoying details which one would not expect in a 5 star hotel.

John I	Beautiful but loud!!!	A beautiful old refurbished colonial hotel right on the sea wall of the Indian Ocean. Very elegant surroundings and excellent service with an outstanding buffet and fine dining restaurant. We stayed 2 nights there but there are 2 draw backs. One the ball room is on the 2nd level and there’s a wedding going on. The booming disco music is not only loud but shakes the whole floor and walls. Sleeping is out of the question. The other is price one night is different then the other by 40 percent. It’s to bad. The Indian disco music is driving me nuts and I have a 3am wake up call. My room is 3069 if the GM reads this review. Stay at the Taj across the street.	Date of stay: October 2017

cday72	A night in Colombo	"A grand hotel in the colonial tradition. Restaurant and lobby areas are lovely with beautiful fittings and service.  A good range of Traditional Sri Lankan and Western food at breakfast.  The rooms are clean and simple. The location is superb, with wonderful views over the Indian Ocean at Sunset.  Seafood buffet, not the best value in Colombo but easy for the overnight stay in a difficult city."	
Raman M	"Great location, fantastic views - but average service"	"One of our rooms was sea facing and offered great views off the balcony, the other looked into the staff  parking lot.  The living space for both was insufficient.  You could also hear all the noise from the corridors outside.  The staff was also trying the hard-sell on the city tours and the use of the hotel taxis.  You are better off using Uber.  What stood out though was the breakfast.  Great variety between different types of Hoppers (Aapams), curries, sambols, cereals, breads, pastries. yogurts, juices and ice-creams.  Had a great time just working through the variety available and chatting with the family."	Date of stay: October 2017
meaganschick	4 nights in old beautiful hotel	"What a beautiful old colonial hotel,reeks of British influence before the war ,romantic  with sea waves breaking below.at six every night the bagpipes play as the flag is lowered. Our rooms have gorgeous antique furniture The cocktail list is extensive and not expensive.The buffet breakfast is huge with a chief catering to all your tastes. They serve buffet lunches and dinner ,which again have a huge variety but all I wanted was something light to eat and that's where they miss out. And a decent strong flat white! From a proper machine ,but that will come with time."	Date of stay: October 2017

Perfect location, wonderful staff, nothing is too much trouble and it really does feel like home.  The hotel (like the Imperial in India) even has a signature scent that subtlety perfumes the public spaces.  Can't wait to get back to Sri Lanka and the Galle Face hotel when I do."	
Amani M	Great hotel overlooking the Indian Ocean	"I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights end September. This is the best hotel to stay in Comolbo. The location is perfect. It overlooks the Indian Ocean and nothing can beat that. The swimming pool is huge and the sunset point is perfect. We stayed in the junior suite with the balcony, and no room view can be better than that. The staff are very helpful, cars are readily available to go anywhere with great drivers. We hired a car and driver to go out of the city for a night and it was cheap and very comfortable. Our driver Ulup was very helpful and caring. Overall, the stay at Galle face hotel made our very short Sri Lanka trip absolutely worthwhile."	Date of stay: September 2017
Kalimullah	Old World Charm	"I have stayed at the Galle Face previously and what I find endearing about this hotel is the old world charm it exudes. Like the bar facing the rushing waves and the long verandah -- it reminds me of the many colonial clubs such as the Selangor Club in Kuala Lumpur or the Cricket Club in Singapore. Service is very good and the buffets are sumptuous. On our recent stay, the suite we were in was oddly designed - there's a bathtub smack in the middle of the room, although there is also a separate shower room and toilet. The bathtub could have been removed when the hotel was being re-furbished recently to give it a larger and more airy feel. But the sea-facing balcony was where my wife and I spent the most time when we were in the room. There's something romantic about hearing the"	Date of stay: September 2017

It is elegant and stylish with a sophistication rarely enjoyed these days. The hotel retains it's old world majesty but also offers all of the modern services. The rooms are not large and are a bit dark  but are of an adequate size. Ours overlooked the beach and pool area. The bathrooms offer beautiful amenities with a large walk in shower. The breakfast area is large and offers a range of both Western and Sri Lankan dishes. Afternoon tea and sunset drinks can be taken overlooking the beach from the Checkerboard deck, the Pool Bar or the Verandah Bar.

Peee C	Beautiful hotel. But grumpy hotel staff	"Hotel is tastefully done. But every staff experience tends to be a nightmare.  1. Check-in- time stated is 2pm. We arrived early, gave our bags to the concierge and swiped our cards, etc. We were assured of the room at 2. We arrive back at 2:30 and no sign of the room. We wait till 3:30 in the lobby with children. Even then, no sign of a room. After a few raised voices, an upgraded room is found for us. Could have been done an hour earlier. Just apathy.  2. Drinks at the poolside bar. Service is as bad as can be. The only time the staff smiled was when he saw the tip.   3. Breakfast- both the Egg and Appam live counter staff are, again, grumpy. Will only nod in reply. Checked with both if they could speak English as I didn't want that to be a barrier. They could. Just didn't"	Date of stay: October 2017

Some very basic standards not met - my room was never properly cleaned - damp towels left, tooth past marks not wiped, dirty glasses left, rubbish not removed. Where were the basic toiletries? No body lotion, cotton buds, shower cap - the things you rely upon in a five star hotel bathroom. No bath in any of the newly renovated rooms. Front desk promised to do something about the noise but no follow up - it kept me awake every night. Dining experience generally sloppy, damp chips accompanied drinks in the bar. Dirty dishes piled on tables visible to breakfast guests. Pool changing rooms very bad quality towels at the pool almost threadbear.

Very highly regarded hotel, oldest of all hotels east of the Suez, had very high expectations but I felt the hotel just under-delivered.

Our first stay was only for a day, so we only got an inkling of what the hotel was like.  However, each time we returned, the experience got better and better.   We got a sea-view room on the second stay, and the third stay was an enormous sea-facing room.  This is a historic hotel, founded in 1864, and has maintained the external appearance while modernizing the interior.  The employees consistently aim to please.

Mike Clapham	The Grand Old Lady	"The Galle Face Hotel was originally Galle Face House, a Dutch villa, a popular meeting place for colonials. In 1864 its potential was realised and it was developed as the best hotel east of Suez. It is probably the oldest. In 1894 it was extended to become a luxury 2 storey hotel and several further extensions were added from the early 20th century to become the huge, majestic hotel that it is today. To keep pace with demand and more modern hotels built nearby, the Galle Face Hotel has undergone several improvements since 1970. In April 2013 the hotel closed for its most recent refurbishment and was re-opened for business again on 26 October 2015 by the President.

Reception assured me this would stop at 11.30 .... in fact they turned the noise down but it continued until after midnight. The traffic noise from the road outside then started at 4am.

Kerrien	Best of the best!!!!!!!!	"This is my sixth trip to Sri Lanka since 2005 and each time I visit, I stay at the oldest and most popular hotel in Colombo-The Galle Face. There are of course much newer hotels but they all leave me cold by comparison to this grand old lady who has such a rich history since she was built in 1864. The entire hotel has been tastefully renovated since my last visit, but all rooms, corridors and landings tell the 150-year-old Ceylonese colonial story with the original polished wide floorboards and lots of original pieces of furniture dating back to the hotels opening. Sadly, the old lift has now gone though, along with the fans on the roof of the outside breakfast terrace, but the 3 restaurants, 2 bars and pub still remain. For me, there is just nothing not to like here. Its total"	Date of stay: August 2017
Aussie_Pearl	The best in Sri Lanka!	"Without a doubt this is the best hotel in Sri Lanka!  My husband & I started our recent 2 week trip here with only 2 nights, and we definitely wished we stayed longer!  We had an ocean view suite & it was just divine.    The breakfast (and egg hoppers) was the best we had on our whole trip!  Everything was super fresh & the curries were the best we've ever had - and we've had A LOT!  We also enjoyed cocktails and some other snacks by the pool and this too was totally enjoyable.  The location was great, the staff were great, the room was very comfortable & everything was spotless.    Definitely wished we'd stayed longer.  Be mindful of touts at Galle Face Green claiming to be a 'chef' & wanting you to go to a festival!!!"	Date of stay: July 2017
Jessica	A place like home	"Whenever I visited Sri Lanka, I always come to this place to meet most of my friends. This place is my second home - With a warm welcome from all the staff of GFH, attentive staff service and most of all??the exquisite and delicious  food that they offered in all their restaurants."

JMW24	Beautiful hotel	"This hotel is wonderful, service amazing, rooms clean with lovely linen and really comfortable beds, breakfast great, can't fault the hotel. Hotel has lovely character and charm, would recommend this hotel as a must stay if you want a truly lovely place to stay."	Date of stay: September 2017
FHMKualaLumpur	Excellent Sri Lankan Hospitality	"We stayed at Galle Face for 4 days. The service was impeccable. The flights into Colombo from Malaysia land very late - tip #1 - book a hotel car (or any car) to get you to the hotel. The airport is a bit chaotic upon exit, so having someone pick you up is good. The driver that picked us from the hotel was extremely pleasant - especially given the late hour.  Siddiq, front desk staff at the hotel, greeted us upon arrival and service was wonderful from him, from the moment we arrived till the moment he escorted us to our uber on our last day. He showed us the rooms available to us so we could pick (I've never had a hotel do that for me before) - he was friendly and made us feel very welcomed.  The hotel is absolutely stunning. It is undergoing refurbishment (so at times can be"	Date of stay: September 2017

Mammabear1	Great old lady	"In the days of high rise, bland hotels this hotel shows the young upstarts how it should be done. Celebrating 150 years of service it is wonderful, large open reception rooms, next to the sea with big terraces, superb salt water swimming pool and the most amazing bar with picture of actors, authors and heads of state that have visited in its long history. The buffet breakfast and dinner offer everything you could want, the staff are attentive....the rooms grand........ loved it."	Date of stay: September 2017

dkemt	Disappointing	Hotel had old world charm but the rooms were disappointing: run down and far from luxurious. Aircon thermostat was not working and was freezing. Beds small and cramped. Food was decent and room service prices very reasonable (E.g. Large American breakfast in room was only about US$10)-this was a nice surprise. Even buffet breakfast was less than US$15.

enjoytravelandlife	"Disappointing service, fungus on ceiling in seaview room"	"Stayed here 3 nights with my wife. Would not recommend for stay, maybe drink at poolbar at best.  Pro's: beautiful building and hotel grounds, definitely 5-star  Con's:  1. Rooms: very basic (max 3-star) although got upgrade to seaview room 2. Bad maintenance of room. Start of fungus growth on ceiling due to humidity (room 4003) 3. Noisy. Got moved twice (=3 rooms) due to wedding party which made floor tremble. 4. Poor management: complained about trembling floor at 10PM. Only after threatening to leave hotel and lots of shouting, managed to get ""solution"". ""Solution"" = smelly, dusty room under wooden staircase. Got woken up every time someone climbed the stairs... 5. Poor, indifferent service at restaurants: think people who can't produce friendly smile should not work in"	Date of stay: September 2017

RaveCity67	Disappointing	"I think that this is primarily a function hotel (five weddings in our three day stay!), so it is geared up for high guest turnover and mass catering.  The evening weddings were noisy and as most hotel guests were attending them the rest of the hotel lacked atmosphere.  Service was generally very slow - it was pretty hard to get a drink!  The gym and spa were closed and I was disappointed not to be told of this when we booked.  I also tried to book the posh restaurant, but that was pre booked for another function  I wrote twice to the hotel before arrival with general enquiries and didn't hear back on either matter.  Our room was ok, but pretty bland with poly cotton (I think!) sheets which were not nice.  We had a huge balcony with a good view, but it was baked in sun from"	Date of stay: September 2017

SammyStu	Amazing pool side view and food	"Was at the Galle Face Hotel a couple of nights ago. Did not stay there, but the experience of eating at the pool side bar right in front of the ocean as the evening changed to dusk changed to night, was one of the headiest travel experiences I have had.  Later, a tour of their bar revealed portraits of some of the most famous personalities in the world  who have visited the hotel. Truly, a magnificent experience!"	Date of stay: August 2017

Brian038_13	Grand	It was 24 years that I was revisiting the hotel. 1993 it was gloomy and run down. Had everything I would expect from its grandeur. Service was excellent. Well restored that you could hardly tell what the new or old part was.	Date of stay: August 2017

Walkley123	Colonial Asian Lux	"From arrival to checkout this hotel and staff provide all the best of Asian Luxury. Refurbished 3 years ago with great respect to the original, this is an endlessly elegant property. Staff response is rapid and flawlessly smooth.  Buffet of local cuisine plus international fare as impressive as it is delicious. Pool , bar areas and verandah seating reminiscent of the good old glory days without the pomp and segregation.  We stayed in a superbly flowing suite, rich in dark timbers and subtly toned silks with several French doors opening onto a vast private balcony. Local friends arrived armed with grilled lobsters and lagoon crab curries: staff provided all necessary to enjoy our wine and food and a great experience on our balcony overlooking the  Galle Face beach.   5 star all"	Date of stay: July 2017

Mark S	A Memorable Stay at an Iconic Landmark	"Colombo was the first stop on our honeymoon, so my wife and I wanted to stay somewhere special to kick off the trip. With its history and amazing location next to Galle Face Green, the Galle Face Hotel was exactly what we were looking for. Even though it's definitely out of our normal price range, I had no regrets staying here! While our room didn't seem especially fancy, it was spacious with great A/C, a powerful shower, and the best Internet connection we had in the country. The views on the grounds are fantastic and the breakfast buffet was plentiful and delicious. The location is simply amazing, and walking along Galle Face Green at sunset amongst local families was one of the best memories of the whole trip. The hotel staff were very kind and polite, and they certainly made"	Date of stay: August 2017
Debbie B	Beautiful Hotel in good location	I always stay at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo and am never disappointed.  The hotel is clean and spacious with multiple restaurants which is good when travelling for work. The pool bar is a great spot for a casual dinner and a drink whilst hearing the sea crashing on the beach. The staff are so helpful. Thank you for a great stay.	Date of stay: July 2017
hardysingh	Quaint old world hotel. Mostly refurbished	Iconic old world hotel. Great outdoors for cocktails or evening tea with sunset views and a pool along the sea.

Nicolas M	Galle face hotel	"It's a very nice hotel, historical , superb entrance hall but rooms are a little tired and sheets not fresh Good breakfast , no naturel juices The first night from 9 to 11h30 pm they put the music like in a discothèque , was it a wedding? They should inform us before"

ES1987-AH	"Stunning, iconic hotel with first rate staff"	"We stayed here for the last night of our honeymoon and it couldn't have been a better experience. Our gorgeous room (for £150) overlooked the sea to one side and the Galle Face Green to the other. My husband mentioned at reception that it was our honeymoon, and they really made it special for us. All the staff went above and beyond, the room was spotless and the food was incredible - it was amazing value for the quality. We loved walking around in the evening seeing the history of the hotel - the library, the museum etc. It's a really iconic hotel in Colombo and well worth a visit."	Date of stay: August 2017
Aref Dahan	Colonial styled Fortaleza	"This hotel is the best hotel I stayed in Sri Lanka, the hotel name goes back to the Protugese era 400 years ago, although it was build in the Victorian age.

This hotel has been frequented by Kings, Queens, Princes, Film stars, famous authors, and on....the reception area and lounge is superb, when you walk in from the oppressing heat, the airconditioned area gives instant relief. The team are friendly and inviting. Changing currency at the front desk was never a problem. There are various bars and Restuarants, as well as areas to relax, either undercover with ceiling fans, air conditioned areas or sunny. The pool is the only salt water pool in Sri Lanka and is stunning, right near the ocean, surrounded by lounges and tables and chairs. The service here was also superb.

Chelenb33	My favourite location for a cocktail after work	"After several business trips to Colombo, I've worked out that the terrace facing the sea is my favourite place to unwind, have a cocktail and gorge on some yummy snacks. The relaxing atmosphere and view are sensational. Just before sundown there is a quaint lowering the flag ceremony with bagpipes no less! Can't recommend this highly enough."	Date of stay: August 2017
Julie S	A must stay hotel	"We had two nights at this hotel on arrival in Sri Lanka. It proved to be a great choice for the following reasons: 1. Well located-right on the seafront with water views 2. Interesting historic property, renovated and well maintained 3. Beautiful room with very comfy beds 4. A great pool- a swim after a hot day of sightseeing is bliss  5. The main restaurant is located on the terrace on the seafront so is in great spot for enjoying the view and the food is good. 6. The staff are charming and extremely welcoming. THE place to stay in Colombo in my view."	Date of stay: August 2017
Daneger R	Drinks and dinner	We just popped in for afternoon drinks which turned into dinner earlier in August. A must visit if you're in Colombo even if you're not staying at the hotel.   The concierge was fantastic and arranged for our train tickets to be bought and dropped off for us for our Kandy trip the next day.	Date of stay: August 2017
Chamitha	Breathtaking but 30% extra	"A lovely hotel at a very convenient location. The pool and views are breathtaking and perfect for a relaxing drink or two! The hotel amenities and service was excellent. However beware of the hidden 30% taxes that are applied on top of the room rate advertised. When booking it is best to specify your sleeping requirement in terms of the number and sizes of beds (queen, double, single etc) as a triple room consisted of 2 beds where neither was able to fit 2 adults comfortably. This appears to be the case at most Sri Lankan hotels."	Date of stay: July 2017
JeftheRef	The waterfront location is very accessible and handy.	"This was our final hotel for two nights on our Sri Lanka tour and the waterfront position and conditions were great but there is a little catch. The plus plus make thinks expensive when you are staying here. The food, service and selection are great but you get a bit of a shock when you order nice food and drinks and the bill seems to double with all the taxes, be it local or regional. These plus, plus charges are on everything when you stay in Colombo. But you are right downtown and it's a lot easier to see the sights and get to great restaurant's like the Ministry of Crab. We actually caught the public bus along the waterfront to get there for a bit of a hoot, it was very cheap and fun with great disco music and lights on the bus. This historical building layout creates"	Date of stay: August 2017
Edgie74	Disappointing stay in somewhere so promising	"We stayed here for our final night in Sri Lanka. It is a grand hotel, clearly aiming to be top notch. Very smart porters at each door, grand entrance etc etc. Galle Face Green was not quite as we had imagined - one end of it is undergoing a massive refurb and generally the area looks to be going through a huge change. Our rooms were comfortable and away from any noise (I had asked to be away from any events having read previous reviews) - there was a wedding taking place but it did not disturb us at all. Our children enjoyed the salt water pool and we ate at the pool bar, where the service was good. The service at the buffet breakfast on the other hand, was very poor. I asked many times for a second cup of tea, having had to ask several times for my first cup. In the end, we"	Date of stay: August 2017

Trilife	"Grand name, WAY past it's prime"	"The bar has pictures of a slew of celebrities on the wall, mostly from several decades ago. Not sure anyone recent would stay here, unless they are gluttons for punishment.  When we arrived, there was not a porter in sight.  Door locks require a Herculean effort to open, everything seems to need a fresh coat of paint. WiFi is free, but sketchy at best. The in-room fridge seemed to heat it's contents.  When I complained about the noise made by a wedding party, they offered to relocate us in the middle of the night to a downgraded room.  When I asked to check out a day early in the morning, due to the poor experience, they refused to reimburse us, although the night manager had agreed to it.  Sad ending to an otherwise beautiful vacation in Sri Lanka."	Date of stay: August 2017
Jansreviews	Echo of the past with the roar of the sea	"We stayed here for two nights when we arrived in Sri Lanka. It is is a classic hotel with historic charm and great atmosphere. The  public spaces are lovely, spacious and well presented.  The terrace restaurant, the bar and the pool form three sides of a square overlooking the sea, which has big rollers pounding the rocks below. There is even a ceremony to take the flag down in the evening with a bag piper.... quite memorable. The rooms were smaller then those outside the city, but perfectly fine with nice bathrooms. Ours overlooked the main Galle Road, despite that we were not disturbed by the traffic noise. A great way to start our holiday!"	Date of stay: August 2017
CvB20152015	Perfect location in heritage hotel	"This is heritage hotel with prime ocean views. Be warned though for stingy jellyfish even when stepping on the beachfront! Very nice and big seawater swimming pool, beautiful setting for breakfast with excellent selection of food. Great history in and around hotel. Rooms are somewhat small but have all essentials. During our stay in July 2017 the spa and gym were closed for unknown time for renovations - would have been appropriate for management to indicate this in its marketing and website."

jaclmoore	One night but good	"We stayed for one night before flying home. Room was fine , clean & had everything you need. The dining was excellent with a very impressive breakfast buffet. The staff were very accommodating especially a man on reception who arranged for a doctor to visit my daughter and enquired about her & ensured we got our prescriptions. The doctor was also wonderful, Doctor C was kind, helpful and very professional ensuring we were able to catch our return flight."	Date of stay: August 2017

Excellent staff service.  Very good food.  A good night's sleep. What more could you ask for?  Would have liked to have spent more time here, and had a bit more information provided on the history and the layout of the hotel."	Date of stay: July 2017

GinnyGeneve	"Colonial charm, first class service"	"We stayed here 3 nights as a family, in two rooms. The hotel has been designed to face the sea as well as fronting the Galle Face Green, on the side. The pool is great for doing laps and the sun beds face the sea with the waves crashing onto the beach right in front. But the sea isn't for swimming, at least not in August. The sea is too rough. The pool has a pool bar that also serves a short but good menu of snack food. Waiters are very efficient and always available. We ate at the fish restaurant, also on the sea side. This is one of 3 restaurants. I'd say that is a fish lovers dream. The fish can be seen inside on a display on ice where all sorts of fish and seafood is available, as fresh as they come. You decide what you want and how it should be cooked. The breakfast is"	Date of stay: August 2017
la_ura25052013	Galle Face	"On my last trip to Sri Lanka I decided that I absolutely must stay in the Galle Face should I return. So we did... The good: Location - it is centrally located in Colombo, next to the beach and right on the coast. The many bars and restaurants offer a wide variety of experiences without even leaving the hotel. One night we spent at the seafood restaurant which was excellent, another at their fine dining which was equally good though in a different way. The bar area outside near the pool was a lovely place to sit of an evening to listen to the waves. Despite being in a busy city, the Galle Face gives the impression of transporting you to another time and place, old colonialism (in a good way). Drinks prices - even for a five star hotel, these are excellent. The bar staff were"	Date of stay: September 2016
prashant_muddu	Simply Fantastic!	"We were here for 4 nights and I can say this was possibly our best stay. We have traveled around the US, Europe & Asia but never have we had such an experience in terms of the hospitality or the tranquility of the property, even though it is in the heart of Colombo. We were nervous about our little 8 month old baby's first trip but the staff at Galle Face were simply amazing. Their hospitality is truly a class apart and we look forward to going back there for some quality family time."	Date of stay: August 2017

Benwill79	Room for improvement	"Galle Face is undoubtedly one of the most sought after places to stay in Colombo but I think it lacked a few details that make it great.  We arrived at a non peak time and we waited 30 minutes to check in, I appreciate that the staff were very polite and were looking for two rooms together but that should not take more than five minutes.  Some people were treated to a welcome drink at reception, we were not!    During the day the only place to order al la  carte food is at the pool bar, this is a very hot area to be with a baby.  We didn't always want a buffet lunch.  The staff at the pool bar and the main bar are very polite but always seemed one step behind, I don't think they came to our table once without being called.  On several occasions we sat with empty glasses and"	Date of stay: August 2017

A beautiful building right by the sea - It really has been lovingly preserved  and we almost felt like we were on a film set whilst staying there. All staff were welcoming and courteous and we loved our sea view room - very comfortable but still retaining period features. Breakfast is served in the open sided restaurant overlooking the gardens and sea. There was a fantastic choice of  food options on the breakfast buffet - both Sri Lankan and International dishes. Plenty of options for dinner too - fine dining, a fish restaurant, a buffet and bar food - all food and beverages sampled were good value and delicious.

OnTheRoad091982	"Beautiful old hotel in the heart of Colombo, staff cannot do more for you"	"We stayed a total of four nights in this hotel, decided to come back here before flying out of Colombo again. This is a special place. It retains its olde-worlde charm completely. Beautiful building, great views from the pool area, a lovely verandah, amazing food especially the breakfast, good coffee, charming staff. Watch out for the fact that government taxes have to be added on to everything (quite common in Sri Lanka) and also that the cocktails can be a little hit and miss - but apart from those minor points, really an incredibly lovely stay. The staff are what makes this place. So eager to make your stay enjoyable and considerate and charming. We'll be back."	Date of stay: July 2017
E. Karatay	First Stop In Sri Lanka	"We had our summer vacation in Sri Lanka in July 2017 and due to our flight route Colombo was the first stop. Our agency made a one night reservation at Galle Face Hotel. The Hotel is in the city and nearby the sea. Our room was too small.Maybe other rooms are bigger than ours, because the hotel has five stars. The worst thing about the room was the sound of outside. You feel like the window is open. It's very weak and thin, not protective. On the other hand, the room was clean, staff were so helpful and respectful. The breakfast was weak, options were so limited but the location is good to see outside during the breakfast. The last suggest that I can give to the hotel management is the scent is too strong and everybody may not like it. Please arrange the smell in the enterance"	Date of stay: July 2017
5fingers5toes	"Elegant and charismatic hotel, great for family"	"We stayed in the Galle Face Hotel for a few nights at the end of a 2 week trip to Sri Lanka. As a family of 5, we booked interconnecting rooms (a junior suite and double room). We had a very spacious master suite overlooking the sea, which was a stones throw away. The dramatic waves were a soothing sound to sleep with and the windows opened very wide if you like gales of fresh air. Our stay was definitely enhanced because of the view and sound of the ocean as it was so very close. If you can request  an ovean view then I would. The master had a superking bed, huge bath and marble shower. Rooms were excellent.   The unbeatable factor, though, was the attentive, friendly staff throughout the hotel and the charm of its history. This is a venerable hotel, with a long tradition of"	Date of stay: August 2017

The hotel rooms I think now is the time for s little brightness, the wood is very dark, but I understand things can't be changed to much. We had one of you drivers, he was fantastic, very knowledgable, took us to Kandy, became our friend.  So clean, the decor and change of flowers, was such s treat. We would recommend our experience with you. Thank you for looking after us."

Comfortable bed, ample room and facilities to match. Upon awakening we went to breakfast and were stunned by the view. The hotel dining room, pool and bar face the ocean and you are so close you can be lolled into peacefulness instantly. The breakfast buffet was top notch and the staff very helpful. The pool was luxurious in the summer heat. We were so sorry that we were only there for such a short time so we are hoping to return another time"	Date of stay: July 2017

Walking through the hotel, it feels as if you could be on board the titanic - so historic and romantic. Room was nice and fulfilled our needs. Breakfast was fantastic. Upon dusk do yourself a favour and stroll along the promenade with the prawn cake sellars and kids flying kites- it really is quite magical. The only recommendation I have is that the hotel staff give you a tour of the place upon arrival - as although there are a couple bars and restaurants within the hotel it is really difficult to find them without a map being provided (we only found 1864 bar when we checked out and it was already too late!).

StevoHughes1	Classic colonial hotel	"We have stayed at the Galle Face several times over the past 15 years and each time the place and service has improved. It's a classic old style colonial hotel which has been tastefully renovated. Our ocean view room wasn't large but was well equipped with a large shower and the sound of the ocean waves audible. Breakfast on the verandah is to die for - excellent hoppers, sambols and curries.  Service can still be a little rigid at times but the foyer staff are well trained and helpful. Not as cheap or as large as the more modern chain hotels but offering a more boutique and elegant choice."	Date of stay: July 2017
Eliza B	Beautiful	"Only stayed one night on our last night in Sri Lanka at this hotel, but this was my favourite of all the places we stayed.  A large colonial hotel on the water.  Amazing beds, great food and drinks and excellent staff.  Loved it!"	Date of stay: July 2017
Kari D	Colonial style	"We have stayed here before, and wanted to return for the last days of our honeymoon.  The service was good as the staff did their best, but unfortunately not as good as last time we stayed there, which can be explained by that this time it was high seasion and they where hosting a big wedding.  The room was spacious as well as the bathroom,. A small minus was the smell of mold in the room and that the bed sheets where wet. The staff was helpful was helpful changing the bed sheets.   The hotel has a large adults pool next to the ocean with free sunbeds and staff present.   Otherwise it was nice to be back, and we will consider staying here again, next time in Colombo."

themig28	Fabulous Hotel	"Dont miss staying here... Like stepping back in time or into an Agatha Christie novel.  Ambience amazing - the pool bar, buffet food and restaurants a cut above the rest! the cocktail list is very creative! Staff are lovely - extremely helpful,never more so than when my son got ill on our last evening there.Oh to retire there when the time comes."	Date of stay: July 2017
Paul V	Super location with great atmosphere	"We spend one night in the hotel and were given a corner room. You could hear the Indian Ocean pounding its waves onto the shore. Super!!  Room is very clean, super bed and bathroom, free minibar and very comfortable sofa/desk.   Staff is extremely friendly, professional and supportive.   Pool and its location is wonderful.   Buffet breakfast was well organized and had a very good selection of different styles of food.   Thanks for a super night."	Date of stay: July 2017

The pool is great for laps and overlooks the beach. There is a also a spa which looked good but was being refurbished at the time. Staff were extremely helpful. Overall good value for money."

joeN2856YP	Great first night in Sri Lanka	"We arrived at the Galle Face hotel after a long flight and were warmly welcomed by drinks and delicious fudge! The view from our room over the seafront was spectacular with a pool, restaurant area and the Indian Ocean. There is an amazing sunset from nearby Galle Green. The food selection was great from Pub food to Sri Lankan Curry. The staff are helpful and advised us where to visit in Colombo and tuk tuks wait outside the hotel to take you to different places around the city.   The only problem was a leak roof of our room causing water to come in during the night. However, overall, it was an excellent stay!"	Date of stay: June 2017

We were just annoyed by the footsteps sound from our ceiling room as we were lodged at the ground floor room no.1016 . Luckily its our last day of stay , late morning  and were already awake heading for our breakfast. No wonder this was an old building renovated but missed out the floorings!"

saraG1747II	TWO DAY PAMPERED STAY	A wonderful place to spend a couple of days.  Service excellent.  Plenty of staff always on hand and very obliging.  Buffets a wonderful array and choice.  Perfect setting on edge of beach when sitting round salt pool facing crashing waves.  Lovely colonial atmosphere made a change from boutique hotel style.  Very comfortable mattress.	
Q2467USrobertb	Short stay at the Galle Face	"The hotel retains its charm and slightly old world colonial style on the terrace and in the "" coffee shop"" area,  despite the renovations and modernisation. It is probably the last hotel in Asia to preserve this. Long may it continue."	Date of stay: July 2017
SanFranciscoBodie	Classic British historic hotel	"This very large seaside hotel has been in operation since the 1800's.  Fortunately the  exteriors and common areas in the interior have been largely preserved. Ceilings are high, wood abounds, doors are massive.  You feel like you have stepped back into history.  The rooms have been nicely modernized including private baths.  Air conditioned.There are ocean view rooms, partial view, and city view rooms.  Some include verandas.  Your food options are mostly the three times a day buffet, but your choices are massive.  You can test what Sri Lankan foods you might like, or stick to continental. Service is what you expect in a large urban hotel."	Date of stay: May 2017

Adam K	A lovely hotel	"My wife and I stayed here for 5 days the first week of July.  Our first experience with the hotel did not go well at all. My wife and I were arriving at different times and late at night, given this we organised transfers through the hotel. When my wife arrived there was nobody from the hotel to meet her. She eventually got on to the hotel and was told to go to a particular transfer company. That company then sold off the fare to some kid driving a very dirty taxi. When my wife eventually got to the hotel staff all but accused her of making it up, but then went very quiet when she produced a copy of her confirmation email.  That drama aside the rest of our stay was quite pleasant, Our room, 2042, was quite spacious and clean, The shower was really good. The grounds are well"	Date of stay: July 2017
colinlisamatthews	Amazing place	"Lucky enough to stay here recently with my family.  The staff couldn't do enough for us, very friendly and attentive and the location was superb.

DrJHS	Sunset drinks	"We went here for sunset drinks on the last day of our honeymoon before flying home to the UK following a recommendation from our hotel manager in Tri, lake koggala. It's a lovely, stately, impressive looking hotel with an old world charm. We had cocktails & some nibbles, were serenaded by lovely live music & had a delightful few hours there. Although I can't comment on the rooms, the common areas of the hotel looked lovely & the room prices seemed very reasonable. I would certainly recommend sunset drinks here to anyone (make sure you get there early enough to get a good seat) & if we ever go back to Colombo I would certainly consider staying here in the future."

Ripplevale	Service	"Despite the imposing exterior, this feels like a big baggy conference hotel.  It is undergoing renovation so in the afternoon of our stay the serenity consisted of a power drill pretty close by.  But when the work is finished it will have a new spa and gym which will make a big difference to the appeal of the property.    The heart of the hotel is the main verandah, facing the sea which is light and spacious. It feels rather corporate but the breakfast buffet was good and a conference audience made it feel busy.  Staff were attentive but it felt a bit like being processed rather than service - maybe inevitable in this kind of hotel.    We had an unprepossessing room on the ground floor.  I asked for a turn down service which housekeeping cheerfully said they would do but when we"	Date of stay: July 2017
John K	Mini-break in Sri Lanka	"Spent 3 lovely days in this hotel.  A very British 'colonial' style hotel.  Loved the decor and feel of the hotel.  Felt like we had travelled back in time slightly. The location was perfect and the staff were very friendly and provided a first class service. There was a good choice of restaurants with menus to suit a wide variety of different cultures.  The hotel has recently had some restoration done which enhanced it even more.  It had its own museum depicting the history of the Galle Face Hotel, including the car that Prince Phillip owned from the time he lived in Sri Lanka.  The only negative would be for families bringing young children, beware the swimming pool has no real shallow end as it starts from about 5ft deep and gets deeper as you progress to the opposite end."

Uzair Q	ABSOLUTELY AMAZING	"This has been by far the best bang for my buck in a hotel ever. I stayed in room 2004 and the view was great. Staff is supremely helpful, the building so majestic, rooms awesome. The food selection in the breakfast and dinner buffets (about $13 and $20 respectively) is jaw-dropping.   Highly highly recommend. Only downside is the other hotels such as Kingsbury are **slightly** closer to downtown Sri Lanka. So if walking around the hotel to sightsee is important for you, maybe choose those. But other than that, this place was just wonderful. I will remember it forever."	Date of stay: July 2017
kembali2019	Yet again another great stay!	"Stunning old world charm and coming back after a year, the service, the beautiful hotel and rooms are still as good as ever. Before we even arrived Chamith had organised all our transport as we were a large group of 14. Best little coach from Airport to hotel and also organised transport the following night for other members of our party. Thank you so much Chamith for also checking in on us through out our stay to make sure everything was oaky. Best breakfact with local egg and string hoppers and western breakfast. Location of this hotel to the Dutch Hospital Precinct is perfect. Staff are helpful and attentive, A must stay when in Colombo. Thank you for another great stay. Cheers Mark."	Date of stay: June 2017
Silvia_Shev	old time charm in good location	"We had one of the suites towards the back of the hotel and it came with 2 little balconies with sun lounges.  The room was big enough and had a spa bath (which we didn't use). Being one of the oldest hotels in town, the style of the room was - as expected - not modern but still nice enough. Food was good and the view from the dining area is really nice.  The location is good - in the middle of Colombo and by the water."	Date of stay: February 2017

The rooms were well appointed, and the whole hotel has undergone a refurb - it looks to be at its best right now. From the moment you are greeted at the entrance on arrival till your final departure, the service from all the staff is excellent.

PickyTravellerGuy	"A fantastic, grand hotel"	"This was the first hotel we arrived at in Sri Lanka and remained one of our favourites. Great arrival experience with check in conducted in a seating area in the lobby- you immediately feel the character and history of the property, even though it has recently been renovated.   I knew the public areas would be impressive, but was concerned the rooms may have been forgotten about over the years. This proved to be unfounded, and our room although not the biggest, was furnished to a high quality. Particularly happy with the bathroom- large, bright and with a new rainfall shower.  Ate in the Seaspray restaurant and found it excellent, a fantastic fish curry served by very personable staff. Prices to match however! The buffet breakfast was the standard fare, a good selection made"	Date of stay: June 2017

After staying at these other hotels/properties we arrived at GalleFace Hotel with a very high bench mark. The food, service and accommodation at all these places could only be described as top-notch.  The day we arrived at GalleFace we were informed that we would be given an upgrade as it was for three of us, we were having a four night stay and that there was going to be a first time ever Summer party at the hotel that night to which we could attend. But of course food and drinks would be for our own account at the party.   The room that was"	Date of stay: July 2017

Sophie M	A glorious old hotel with exceptional service	"We have had a delightful 2 night stay at the Galle Face Hotel.  We travelled with my older mother and 3 children, aged 14, 5 and 2 - so we have pretty much every age demographic covered and we all loved it. We booked two ocean facing rooms with balconies and were lucky enough to be given room 2044 with a huge corner balcony overlooking the Indian Ocean.  The room was beautiful, dark wooden floors, fresh white linen, big bay windows looking out over the ocean, big enough for a huge King bed with a rollaway.  Lovely bathroom (no bath), but indulgent rainwater shower head with nice amenities.  The staff were incredible - everywhere we turned someone was on hand to offer a smile or assistance.

MrShibuya	As fantastic as they say.	"This hotel was the highpoint of my trip so far. So much character and the staff are just great. Fine for families I imagine but it's not a ""kids club"" type of place. The buffets are very good. The beer could have been a bit colder but that's a minor complaint as it's kind of hard to get ice cold beer anywhere here."	Date of stay: June 2017
RomeshAluwihare	The Galle Face Hotel	In a world of modern hotels the Galle Face Hotel epitomises sophisticated Paradise in a luxurious environment while honouring timeless traditions of courteous service and world clas Sri Lankan hospitality.

The hotel being one of the oldest hotel in the region still maintains its heritage charm .  heritage look with modern amenities .  the wooden floor , high ceilings , heritage decorations with antique  display & a traditional wine cellar all adds to the charm .  The service is excellent & the staff are very courteous & helpful . The food is delicious & the traditional srilankan dishes are absolutely mouth watering . Sitting outside , next to the beach enjoying the natural breeze , the beauty of the sea & delicious food was the highlight of my stay"	
Daniel A	Great hotel with lots of character but certain things soured the stay	"We stayed here for 2 nights opting for one of the 'standard rooms'. Overall the stay was really good, however, the threat of a 150$ fine if you lose your room key was ludicrous. This really annoyed me from the start and put unnecessary pressure every time we left the hotel. I would find myself constantly checking to see if I had the room key whenever I was outside and meant I could never truly relax on my holiday.  Location - Great location for reaching the fort station and the high-end restaurant scene in Colombo. It stands very grand and in the open so is very easy to locate.  Room - Was very nice. The fittings are all modern but in character with the room and style. The free mini bar was a nice touch as well. The choice of pillows meant the sleep was the most comfortable we"	Date of stay: June 2017

BevAnnM123	A wonderful relaxing holiday with memories of the good old days	"I had a wonderful room with a balcony in this wonderful colonial hotel with an ambience all of its won - I wanted a relaxing vacation with day trips, spa and time in the sun, I got that and more.  The service was great. Big shout out to Emmanuel for helping me with activities etc.  The challenge for this hotel will be to retain the relaxed Sri Lankan friendly understated helpfulness and not sucumb to the requirement of some other cultures demanding natures.  It was just what I needed to de-stress - help when I needed it privacy otherwise.  Everyone was just great.  Memories of times gone by - keep this atmosphere please.  Not sure if the words classic or quaint best describe the hotel - it is in a class all of its own.  Loved the history and time with the hotel historian."	Date of stay: June 2017

FeryBaroque	On expensive side but overall worthwhile	"Choose this hotel to end our full week Sri Lanka trip, wise decision. Positive:  1. This old colonial style hotel offers a top hotel experience in all aspects, the location, the architecture, the interior, the room, the food, even the smell...... 2. Room is extremely clean and tidy, wi-fi connection is fast and stable. these are something rare for our whole Sri Lanka trip 3. Bed are comfortable and air-con/ceiling fan is perfectly functioning. we had two best nights sleep for the whole trip 4. Food is good. Buffet covers western and local selection. we love local food 5. Overall staff is helpful, a little toy was given to my girl when we stepped in... 6.

Its not your ultra modern facility but that's what makes it so different and unique."	Date of stay: June 2017
greenflubber	Classic and timeless hotel with colonial flair	"I managed to get a good price for my final night in Sri Lanka, and this hotel certainly delivered. Plenty of history to this hotel - you can read up a ton in the hotel handbook in the room, and everywhere you turn, you feel like you are in British-colonial Sri Lanka.   Service is as good as it gets here. Rooms are spacious and the bathrooms large. While the hotel is old, it doesn't feel old. Great furnishing, timeless and classic.   The bar along the beach front is perhaps the best place to catch the sunset in all of Sri Lanka. It's right next to Galle Face Green but without the crowds. Having a sunset martini or negroni there is definitely something you should do at the Galle Face Hotel! Just mind the waves' spray - on a windy day it can get into your cocktail.  I would highly"	Date of stay: June 2017

familywithtweenies	Not realizing its potential!	"It's a shame that such a grand hotel does not live up to its potential largely due to inconsistencies of customer service and weak management control.  There are of course lots of plusses as enumerated by many others, the location, history of the building, pool lounges by the oceanfront, the nice pool, sunset drinks etc.  However, for the price paid, we would expect more.  First, a decent roll-away bed for the 3rd guest rather than a camp bed.  We would not expect to have mould/dirt around the bathtub edges.  A few staff were friendly and helpful but they were the exception rather than the norm.  The pool attendant just sit with the towels and do not actively lay out cushions & towels for incoming guests and remove them after guests leave.  At breakfast, the staff had glum faces"	Date of stay: June 2017

Drinks and food are not cheap, breakfast was over £10 (we should have booked online) but it was very pleasant, in a great setting with attentive staff.  We had a superior room met all our need and the fridge with complementary soft drinks and snack was a bonus.

Colombo is a bit of a dump at times so finding a haven to relax in comfort away from the smoke, dirt, and heat is a must. The poolside bar area at the Galle Face offers seating facing direct out to the ocean only metres away.   The drinks are standard hotel prices and the sea breeze is free."	Date of stay: June 2017

Our room was lovely and had everything we needed - all very high quality. The location was great, right on the sea front, where we enjoyed a lovely drink before dinner watching the sunset. Staff were lovely and very willing to help. Our stay was only very brief but it was a fantastic way to end our amazing holiday to Sri Lanka."	Date of stay: June 2017
Ana Cecília Sabbá	Two Pandora bracelets stolen from my room	"The hotel is quite beautiful and right in front of the beach. But it is really old and it smells old. The breakfast was okay but nothing amazing. For the price, considering that it is located in Sri Lanka, we would expect more. However, if you are looking to stay in this hotel BE VERY CAREFUL WITH YOUR BELONGINGS, my two Pandora bracelets (worth more than 2,500 american dollars) were stolen from my room to be never found. I would NEVER stay there again. You do not feel safe AT ALL."	Date of stay: June 2017
Sean H	"Galle Face Hotel, very historic and elegant building"	"We had a lovely relaxing stay, the one problem we had was our clothes got damp in the room, the balcony door was always closed because it was very humid, but even the bedding felt damp to touch, whether the fan was on and A/C off it made no difference.  We also booked a day trip which was not cheap, but we had our won driver and car for the day, and on the way back I was asked to pay the toll fee, although not much money it was not expected, we also booked and paid for the private car airport collection service however our return trip was in a mini bus with no refund offered, I just felt like I was being robbed all the time, shame as the break was overall very nice."	
omniadubitare	Fabulous!	"My parents, brother, husband and I stayed a night before heading to our villa in Tangalle. We've stayed at the Kingsbury, Cinnamon Grand in the same area/price point and have to say that the Galle Face is hands down the winner and we'll look no further for hotels for our trips to Colombio/SL in the future.  The GFH has so much character and charm without compromising on comfort and service. All rooms have a beautiful sea view and the bathrooms are lovely. Location is perfect and both restaurants are very good+value for money dining options. The entire hotel reeks of old world charm and if you're looking for that certain something more than just the same old regulation 5 star experience, GFH is the place to stay in Colombo."

I had been to Colombo before and it does seem impressive from the outside so I fell for the Colonial Heritage line and that the famous “so and so and so and so” had always stayed here. A huge monolith of a place it’s cavernous hallways are dark and dingy and it’s rooms, well the first one that I was given, smelled of mould and decay.          The whole place is well past it’s used by date, it must cost a fortune to maintain but obviously the budget doesn’t run to refurbishing the worn scuffed floors or replacing the sad and sorry lounge chairs around the pool, they were a disgrace.

Ansarinz	Great property but...	"We have stayed here twice. Once before it was renovated and the last time just last month. The building has character and its location is excellent and has potential to be one of the great hotels with more attention to details. Maintenance was also lacking in many areas of the hotel, the rooms damp. My wife and I felt the service level was not consistent and with exception of a few outstanding staff the rest could do with lots more customer service training."	Date of stay: May 2017
jessmcd1985	Old fashioned Luxury!!	"We stayed for our last night in Sri Lanka and it was utterly luxurious. Obviously it's quite pricey... The room was very comfortable and we were upgraded to a suite as there was some minimal noise from a wedding function in that section of the building...but we weren't disturbed at all. The building is beautiful, and filled with lovely art and furniture. We ate at their Sea Spray restaurant and it was delicious. My only improvement would be the cocktails, my negroni was very watered down and for 950rs it should've packed a punch. Breakfast buffet is a must; it was utterly fabulous! Many thanks to the wonderful staff for thief exceptional hospitality. If only life could be like this all the time for everyone!!"	Date of stay: June 2017
BongGio	Wonderful experience of bygone times	"This hotel has, for me regained its famous historical place as "" The world's finest hotel East of Suez"". The extensive and generally appropriate renovations have added modern comfort without compromising the gracious colonial elegance. Dignified, attentive staff are a welcome feature as is the sumptuous offering of Sri Lankan delicacies in the Verandah Restaurant, set back just the right distance from the crashing surf. The historical tour offered to guests is informative and interesting. The experience of staying at The Galle Face  is, a memorable  evocation of this fragrant island's colonial past."

The rooms are spacious and clean with old school charm. Breakfast was fantastic with egg hoppers, chapati and all other egg choices available to order along with a great buffet. All staff have been very polite and friendly. Pool is great with deck chairs overlooking the sea.   One downside is the hotel is on a busy road but despite our room being quite close to it, the noise is not too noticeable and wasn't audible at all at night. Also at the time we visited the gym/spa was closed for renovation."	Date of stay: June 2017
TonyB932	One of my favourite hotels in the world	This is one of my absolute favourite hotels.  The character and history of this hotel make it so much more enjoyable than the typical modern 5 star hotel.  The service is also some of the best I have experienced with the attentive staff everywhere and always friendly and willing to help.  An example is that I needed some business clothes pressed so I had them collected as part of the normal laundry service (drop off by 10am and get back by 5pm that same day).  I had them back in less than 10 minutes!  I am not sure if that is normal service for this hotel but it has never happened at any other hotel I have stayed in and demonstrates the staff's commitment to guest service.

Kind and welcoming staff could not have been more helpful, especially in finding a lost passport (it had somehow fallen under the bed), the next morning. A beautiful colonial era hotel, spotlessly clean. The G&T on the terrace with waves crashing was a great start to our tour. The buffet in the evening was beautifully prepared. We were kindly upgraded to a (premium) room which was super comfy. As we would miss breakfast due to an early train, a breakfast box contains sandwiches, pastries, fresh fruit, iced tea was provided. We have another night here before returning home. Can't wait."	Date of stay: June 2017

shinyee_foong86	Amazing stay	I have a 3 nights stay here and the stay was pleasant. There is an area near to the swimming pool where you can see the sea view while having your breakfast. The staff are polite and the hotel design is very antique.	Date of stay: November 2016
Bridget W	"OK, a bit pricey, good breakfast, lovely pool"	"The hotel is lovely but it's a bit dated now and they are obviously upgrading parts of it, as the gym was not available. The first room we were in (the standard twin) was not pleasant, it was really tired, had a view of a car park, was musty smelling and the air con wasn't getting the room cool. We asked to moved and were (at substantial cost) to a balcony room overlooking the ocean. That room was much better in amenities (better bedding, toiletries etc) but the room had a horrible smell of sewerage and there was banging in a nearby room (associated with renovations?) until well after 9pm. There was also a couple of plastic bags kicking around the balcony which took away from the upmarket feel of having a balcony room. When we advised reception of the bad smell, they insisted"	Date of stay: May 2017
SUROJIT G	Awesome	The best hotel we have ever stayed . The view from our room facing the galle face green and from the coffee shop facing the ocean was breathtaking.  Our huge room with a massive bathroom and a complimentary mini bar stuffed with goodies was the icing on the cake. The museum inside the hotel with a vintage car on display was a very interesting experience  our overnight stay at this heritage hotel was like living inside a museum with exotic artefacts	Date of stay: May 2017

JAKEParis	Pit-stop after an overnight flight	The Galle Face is a traditional old colonial hotel with lots of history.  It's comfortable and the staff friendly and efficient.  The bedroom felt a little damp but we visited in the hurricane season and am guessing the windows aren't opened very often during this time of year.  We ate in the main terrace restaurant which was good value and had a wide variety of food both local and western.  We only had a few hours in the evening to see Colombo and so chose one of the tuktuk drivers waiting outside the main entrance as our guide.  Ravi - owner of one of many red tuktuks - showed us sights and parts of the city we would never have found on our own - his price was fair and he did a great job as tour guide - he also took us into the main Buddhist temple and showed us around during	Date of stay: May 2017
Nadira Y	Rotten reception staff in an otherwise great hotel	"It is a shame that the people entrusted with greeting and looking after the comfort of the guests in this hotel are so rude, arrogant and completely lacking in any understanding of good customer service. In contrast, literally every other staff member of the hotel including waiters, doormen, house keeping etc are exceptionally helpful and apparently well trained in customer service.  I'm guessing if one has no problems with ones booking and one can escape the nagging and bullying reception staff, one could have an enjoyable stay at this hotel. I, however, was not so fortunate. A breakfast and dinner deal offered by Wotif and confirmed in the booking email from Wotif was not recognised by the hotel. When I informed them that they needed to fix that problem with the booking agent"	Date of stay: May 2017
Carmina S	Best Hotel in Colombo	"Amazing! We only spent one night there, but I am already nostalgic.  The restaurant 1864 was more than I expected, the ambiance was perfectly and carefully built, we had an excellent wine while listening to Frank Sinatra.  The staff is very helpful, the whole hotel is high standard and modern, maintaining the spirit of the promising times when it was built. This is the best hotel in Colombo!"	Date of stay: May 2017

Matt G	"Terrific hotel, great charm!"	"Not only the hotel, but also the hotel is charming. Mr Mohamed Siddique, the lobby manager, went out of his way to ensure that my wife got a room that met her needs for our week-long stay. We will certainly be back, and will recommend this hotel to colleagues and friends traveling to Colombo.   The nightly ceremony of retiring the national flag, with bagpiper and ritual, was a special feature of the hotel.   The extensive and changing selection of local and international foods on the breakfast buffet was a joy each morning.   The housekeeping staff were exceptionally thorough and attentive, even shaping the bath towels into a elephant one night.   The hotel has an exceptional history of famous guests and a small museum featuring Prince Philip's first car."	Date of stay: May 2017
MarthaMaryB	My favourite hotel in Colombo	"I have just stayed here for 3 weeks whilst working in Colombo and I cant fault this place.. I am always made to feel so welcome here and it is nice to see friendly faces when I return each year.  All the staff (of which there are sooooooooooooooooo many) are 100% attentive and polite, they have really made my stay so enjoyable.  The morning and evening buffet selection in the restaurant is amazing and I love having my fresh fruits, banana, papaya, pineapple, watermelon, grapes, passion fruit and more to start my day off.  I will miss the food when I get back to England.  My room attendant Keeth and his colleagues made up my room everyday at least once and my sheets and towels were always crisp and clean.  My jewellery and belongings were left out and I felt 100% happy with that"	Date of stay: May 2017
nadia_lindberg	Happy stay	We had a lovely time staying at this hotel. A few problems were swiftly attended to by friendly staff. Recommend sea view rooms. Having breakfast to the sound of the waves was magic. Down side the hotel should think of more restaurants!

Ben T	Oldest and still amongst the best	"The location is amazing - views out to sea and across the developing Galle Face green. The hotel has been thoroughly refurbished but still has a strong sense of its former self. Anyone who had the chance to stay there pre-renovation will miss its quirky charm and lack of facilities but will enjoy the enhancements; the rooms no longer have massive free standing air-con units the size of an Airbus engine, the bathrooms are great and there are still large landings with antique cabinets.   The pool is lovely - quiet, views across the sea and salty fresh; the gym was under renovation so access is given to a near-by hotel.   Food was good: 850 LKR for an enormous local curry with four choices of main dish cannot be beaten I think!  Staff are still a little dazed but helpful and ever"	Date of stay: May 2017

cedejay	Buffet Lunch and The Verandah Restaurent	"We booked a 12 person table for a special occasion at The Verandah Restaurant for a family get together of rather elderly family on 13 th May 2017.  Due to various reasons we needed a table close to the buffet as well as without climbing steps.   The staff were very helpful in every aspect of handling the guests who were rather elderly and might sometimes had specific requests. They were ready to help with the serving, bringing in extra servings, finger bowls etc.  This was a very special occasion for my family everyone on duty that day including the service at the lounges and Travellers' Bar were very helpful in making the event memorable."

Mary-53-2004	Superior turns out to be inferior	"This a generally wonderful hotel with heritage, magnificent public areas, delicious food and a lovely setting but our room described on their website as 'superior' turned out to be anything but. 'Superior' rooms are small, cramped and very dated rooms at the back of the hotel looking over roofs a few metres away. Others travelling with us received the same. Clearly these rooms need to be renovated or retired. We had a leaking basin, no bed side lamps and mould in the shower  and a double bed rather than a queen in a room we could barely walk around without tripping over our suitcases. Galle Face management need to take these complaints seriously."	Date of stay: April 2017
Mike F	Dinner on the Veranda at Galle Face Hotel	"Business dinner on the Veranda at Galle Face Hotel. Good service, incredible selection of food at the buffet, catering for all tastes - if you take a little of everything, you will be eating for a week, the selection is truly immense, very tasty and authentic.  Had previously been on the Veranda about 2 years ago, but the food this time was far superior to what it was previously. Well worth the visit, but please note: the food is authentic Southern Asian only."	Date of stay: May 2017
cf99	A Cool Oasis	"Stayed here for a couple of nights and it certainly met our expectations. Good room and superb breakfast with wide variety of western and Sri Lankan options in a chilled out environment overlooking the sea. Prices for car trips were quite a bit over the odds but that's was to be expected. A happy hour for selected cocktails on the veranda hit the spot, and all the staff were efficient and helpful throughout."	Date of stay: January 2017

nagaf2015	SERVICE IS EXCELLENT!	"I was working at GFH for 2 weeks.  My room was upgraded to a junior suite. I suspect they keep those rooms just for upgrades (for regular or long stay customers) but I could be wrong! the rooms were serviced twice a day, there were complimentary soft drinks and water bottles, the paper was delivered some mornings, and (on slow days??) there were towel sculptures on my bed! This was in addition to the lovely extra touches- sweets, coconut lotion, ayurvedic soap and shampoos etc. Nights with weddings were quite loud in my room as the music was thumpy and loud, but one attendant advised me to have the bed in my extra room made up, as that space gets no noise.  I didn't even know that sofa was a bed!  We booked a car from the hotel to get to the airport, and were touched by the gift"	Date of stay: April 2017
eton1970	Heritage Property with all the Charm & Quirks	"Lovely hotel within Colombo. Historic property that stands out from the usual hotels. Large and rustic rooms with modest wifi/air con but gets the job done, Beautiful outside dining areas and the inside bar and restaurants are lovely.  Excellent food. Staff is well meaning & works hard. Ocean facing rooms are the best (avoid the street side ones due to the noise). Gym was closed due to renovations so used Ramada (a 5 minute walk) which barely worked. Overall the property is a step back in time with all the charm and grace though don't expect the full functionality of a new build property which in my case, is fine. Worth a stay."

Hilmy_Sally	Take a bow grande dame........	"Went back a couple of months ago to check out the state of this iconic institution, post-renovations. Congratulations! A job well done.   Taking in the sunset over the ocean, sipping sun-downers by the poolside must rate as one of Colombo's ultimate experiences. The food and drink are good and the service, from the waiting staff to the parking attendants, is excellent.   Keep it up as you head towards your double-century milestone."	Date of stay: March 2017
Traveller22	Visiting a Grand Old Lady	"We have visited the hotel many times over the past thirty years, for drinks, meals and to attend wedding banquets from time to time. The hotel has lots of nostalgic charm and is a throwback to a bygone era. The recent renovations have really improved the hotel and brought many aspects up to date... The Verandah restaurant was quite poor in terms of both food production and service, but has now been restored to its former glory, the service is far more friendly and efficient and the food is EXCELLENT!! There is a new Chef in town.... and he has performed miracles lifting the quality and presentation in all the restaurants including the hotel 1826 Grill Room and Seafood restaurant.... WELL DONE!!!"

2ktravel	Like stepping back in time	What a great grand historical hotel.  It sits right on the ocean with big open verandas to sit out on and gaze at the water with the sound of waves crashing.  We were only here for one night but loved everything about the place.  Our high floor ocean facing room was perfect and quiet.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Breakfast was good with an enormous selection of food.  We had an excellent dinner in the 1864 Restaurant (great decor too). We just wish we had planned a second night here.	Date of stay: March 2017

Kenichi S	Great Historical experience	"This is the 3rd time for me to stay in this hotel and I must say the historical mood of the hotel remains the same. It was just several wedding ceremony planned in the same day and the hotel was total packed with wedding guests, which was a little too much as if the hotel was a theme park... However the bar, the pool was absolutely amazing and bring you straight back to the good old days right away."	Date of stay: May 2017

xyztraveler1965	Calle Face Hotel in Colombo	I had a great stay here. I wish I had more time to enjoy the pool and patio - especially at sunset when they play bag pipes and take down the flag for the evening.  I had one night of limited sleep due to a wedding in the hotel that went on until 11:30 pm and then the furniture was moved at 5 am!  My room needed a little painting and cleaning of tile grout but otherwise it was a great stay!	
Satveer K	Amazing affordable hotel	This is a true 5* hotel with an amazing historic colonial feel. Worth every penny.   Excellent location.   Grounds and building decor are magnificent.

Sea spray restaurant has a range of sea food dishes and the staff offer and exceptional service.   Plenty of options for breakfast. Breakfast is available from 6:30 am. Only down side was I lost my card on the day we checked out and we had to leave at 7:30am.

Heshani E	"Fab, as always."	This is probably the most beautiful hotel in Colombo. I have stayed here for the past 20 years on a regular basis. The bagpipe man is classic! Was watching it with my friend from Edinburgh...this happens every evening at sundown. Overall lovely experience. Not sure what I think about the crow chasing man (this has not changed over the year )sand 'others' having a champagne breakfast...	
Glenn B	Excellence	"From the ceremonial lowering and raising of the flag, tea on the verrandah and evening sunsets. This hotel is one i have returned to several times over the last 20+ years. It has had its charms and its creaks in a well balanced order. Quite simply the galle face hotel will always be the king of Colombo."	
The80sTravellers	Last stop on our honeymoon	"The hotel has two sides- the south is the older side and the north has been renovated. We were initially put in a room on the south side and it looked very tired and old so asked to be moved to the north of the hotel, we had to wait a while before someone arrived to take us to the furthest point of the hotel and stayed in a corridor where spare bedside cabinets and camp beds were kept which was not a great feeling but the room it self was lovely, nice views (no balcony) that overlooked the pool and a bit of the sea. Room 4040 is really nicely done which was a big difference to room 2020 which we were initially assigned. The only downside is when there is live music you can hear it very clearly so early sleepers wouldn't be too happy!   Both rooms seemed to be missing a few items"	Date of stay: April 2017

lakelad	Well done GFH	"Great to be back at the Galle Face Hotel after some years and the recent refurbishment.  The hotel is still fabulous with its prime historic location and quite tangible sense of its long history.  Slight disappointment at the removal of some original or old elements, e.g. seats at the southern end of the verandah.  Updating does tend to do that.  We booked through our local travel agent last year and before 2017 Colombo rates had been confirmed.  Our booking was confirmed by said agent at the 2016 rate with a ""free upgrade to an ocean view room"".  Upon check-in the free upgrade wasn't honoured and we were given what maybe one of the poorest rooms now in the hotel.  Fourth floor southern wing, Galle Road end with all the accompanying traffic noise, limited space, no bedside table"	Date of stay: April 2017
David P	Beautiful Hotel if a little tired	Stayed here after a hectic week in Hong Kong and just wanted to relax. It was also our wedding anniversary on the trip. Our first room was very tired so we asked for an upgrade which we got the next day. Very well appointed room in the part of the hotel that had been renovated. We received free wine on arrival and on departure. For our anniversary we were presented with embroidered dressing gowns and laundry bags. The breakfasts were superb each day and the pool was very warm but seawater.  Ate in the hotel one night. The buffet was very extensive but I was disappointed with the range of flavours in the different curries. They all tasted pretty similar. The best thing was going out onto Galle Face green in the evenings as it was so vibrant and heaving wth humanity. We were there	Date of stay: April 2017

The bars are clean and the staff are keen to help.  The food is very good.  We were there for my wifes birthday and the staff at breakfast came out with a cake and sang happy birthday to her.  Some of the people that have stayed at this hotel include a Pope, Prince Phillip and various countries leaders, so you know the standard will be high."	Date of stay: April 2017
"Here, there and everywhere!"	"Great location, reasonable accomodation"	"Stayed one night after arriving in Sri Lanka, hotel is nicely situated on the ocean front but no real beach, small pool which gets quite busy.  Food/Drinks - expensive like most hotels in Sri Lanka, at least 50% on top of what you would pay outside the hotel, service is average and the breakfast buffet looked good although I took the breakfast takeaway as I left early. Bit of a fiasco getting the takeaway correct but got there eventually.  Room - the room was nice enough, clean and great bathroom with huge shower, the hotel has kept the historic look which means that you can here the horns blasting in the night but this did not stop me sleeping, what did was the old wooden floorboards and people (kids) running around which makes one hell of a noise if you are next to or below"	Date of stay: April 2017

The building and position is a perfect place for your time in Colombo. We had a lovely 2 night stay and would have loved to stay longer. The staff was very attentive , yet not in your face.

WakeBoris	Historical and elegant hotel	"The French ambassador to the Maldives and Sri Lanka loves this place, so you'd have to expect a big dose of professionalism that targets the Westerner sensibilities.  One of the most beautiful old style hotels I've stayed at, with all manner of luxury that you'd want. However if you are a traveller who often or solely resides at 5 star hotels, I'm sure you will find some holes in their game. But, if you are like us who only rarely stay at such places, the comfort and style is overwhelming. They upgraded us to a 3rd floor superior room overlook the ocean - thank you. The pool is a marvel! The Resturant was expensive, around $25USD per person for buffet, but delicious. This is a great place to stay on your last night in Sri Lanka. Comfortable and happy end to our trip."

The history of the place is very interesting but we still found the accommodation to be very nice and comfortable with all the modcons you expect from a 5 star place.

From beginning to end, my stay was excellent.  The breakfast buffet, included in my reasonable rate, was among the best I've ever had.  A huge array of options, both Sri Lankan and western, that made breakfast something to look forward to every day. The dinner buffet which we ate the first night was equally good.  The location of the hotel was perfect for our exploration of the city, whether on foot or Tuk Tuk, and close to Colombo Fort for longer distance rail journeys.  The WiFi was high speed and never failed.  The room and bathroom were very nice, with an understated colonial grandeur.  All in all, the Galle Face Hotel"	Date of stay: April 2017

From our very short visit, it looked amazing. Truly upmarket, the lobby was both huge yet unassuming - dominated more by the flowers and chandeliers than by the desk or staff.  We were generously allowed  to wander through the public areas and delighted by the feel of a gracious and impressive hotel. Whether you stay or just visit as we did, do not miss the display of photographs and the original car that belonged to the Duke of Edinburgh in the surprisingly impressive museum area."

The atmosphere is something to behold and while not up to Raffles Singapore service or amenity levels offers the same sort of olde world charm for a fraction of the cost. My only disappointment (and reason not 5 stars) was the food.  While only two meals the seafood restaurant left me very unsatisfied (felt like I needed to go to dinner again afterwards) with lots of little crab legs with hardly any meat, flat wine (thankfully replaced) and averages accompaniments.  The breakfast was thankfully better and at least I was sufficiently fed but the quality could be better.  If food is not your thing then the setting, atmosphere and service were all 5 star and an experience well worth trying."	Date of stay: April 2017

LibbyT196	Smiles go a long way	"Our last stay in Colombo.. what a beautiful old hotel , rich in history. Make sure you have plenty of small notes for tips. The front of house reception could have been a lot more friendly.. smiling would be been a good start. We travelled right throughout Sri Lanka for our honeymoon. This last hotel was not our finest stay."	
Sarahnliam49	A taste of the past	"We spent 4 nights here and just loved the place and its old colonial feel. Great rooms, great service, great food ( especially breakfast!) and a great pool and lounge area opposite the sea! After touring the island, we came back for one more night and we were upgraded to a suite- just amazing!! A great place to relax and start your time in Sri Lanka!!"	Date of stay: April 2017
ChrisandJudy1000	Brilliant example of colonial elegance	"From the moment we arrived at the Galle Face, we got the sense of an old world charm and luxury that stayed with us throughout our all too short stay.  Located right on the beach yet in the centre of Colombo, this old building has been well maintained and carefully modernised to retain the best of its colonial origins yet provided modern luxuries.    Our room was in the north wing with a large private balcony overlooking the lawns, outdoor eating and bar areas, pool and the ocean.  The room itself was spacious with large separate bathroom, dressing and shower areas.  Floors were the original wide timber boards (with a few creaks to prove it).   Every part of the room was very clean and delightfully furnished.    The bed was very comfortable.    WiFi was provided and worked well."	Date of stay: April 2017

cyril_lm2013	"Great location and beautiful historic building, but terrible service"	"Stayed there just for an afternoon before taking our flight We had 2 meals and had rented a room The place is beautiful, the building is close to 200yrs old, fantastic location on the sea The food was actually quite good Big issue is the service : although staff is very nice, they are SUPER slow and inefficient.  - The check-up (for one room) took 25 mins, and we were the ONLY guests at reception  - arranging a car for the airport required speaking to 4 different people at 3 different desks  - we had to wait 45 mins (!!!) between ordering and getting our food at the pool bar. Considering we requested pasta for the kids and sandwiches for us, and that we asked for our food 3 times before getting it, I struggle to understand how it took so long (no explanation was given of course)"	Date of stay: April 2017
BoatGR	Not Sure	"I chose the title for this review as ""not sure"" to reflect how I felt about the place. I felt the room we had fell a bit short for what we paid and that was simply the size of the room. It was a bit small and certainly the view was very limited from a single window. So avoid room 3043 if possible. The verandah restaraunt for the breakfast and dinner buffet has a great view to the ocean and the evening cultural dance was good. Like all buffet's there are peak times where there are plenty of people nudging each other for their meals. Speaking of meals I thought the food was satisfactory and no one will starve, but the ""wow"" factor was lacking. All staff were friendly but seemed weary and I base that comment on seeing staff serving meals at around 8 at night and then again up early"	Date of stay: April 2017
devindak2017	Great venue but service can be better	"Super venue for city large hotel. Wish the hotel staff is more liberal thinking, i.e. out of the box. Friendly staff nevertheless. Great choice of food. Please concentre now quality as you got most of the categories right."	Date of stay: March 2017
Lapun	Great sunset setting	"We didn't stay at the Galle Face but did watch the sun go down over the sea while enjoying their fabulous food and drink service, something not to be missed. Afterwards we inspected the hotels magnifi ent public rooms."	Date of stay: February 2017
RoamerSE	Going back in time	"Even if you don't stay here, you must go for a drink at least, just to take in the atmosphere and admire the décor. It's just like going back to colonial days. Overlooking the Indian Ocean, the hotel lies at the end of Galle Face Green where people relax and men and children play cricket and fly kites. It marks the start of the bustling and colourful shopping area but in the evening, particularly at sunset, it's a lovely place to relax after a busy day of sightseeing and crazy tuk-tuks!"

Anne H	Wonderful hotel!	Absolutely great beachside hotel! High class standard on everything and good service. There is champagne for breakfast and the staff brought cake and the birthday song for my boyfriend who had a birthday! The price is also very good compared to what you get. Value for money and highly recommended!  John & Anne	Date of stay: January 2017

Carol F	Great location	"The location and Grandeur of the hotel is exceptional  the food was equally good,the only thing that disappointed was the smell in the room we had was off putting we complained to staff they said they would put disinfectant down the drain but failed to do it needs to be sorted we would not go back again, unless this was fixed . I suppose you have to make allowance for the  the age of the hotel but really not acceptable"	Date of stay: April 2017

Dudley C	Colonial Retreat	"After a hot and hectic day of exploring Colombo, this is where you need to pull up stumps!   Suggest get there at least an hour before sunset to slake your thirst and throttle right back.  Leave the dusty madness of Pettah behind and let the balmy Indian Ocean breeze work its therapeutic magic.  A magnificent old colonial edifice, redolent with times slipped by and visiting celebrities of the day.  Each night as the sun sets, the piper plays as the flag is lowered.  Probably the biggest 'must do' in Colombo"	Date of stay: September 2016
Filip S	Beautiful colonial building	"Great hotel, with excellent friendly staff, great beachfront are and pool. Dinners/breakfasts were excellent, full of variety. The hotel is quite important historically as well, as it was visited by numerous world leaders and movie stars."	Date of stay: May 2016
TallyHo_8	Solid experience and good value	"The rooms here aren't deluxe, but they are clean and practical, the appeal here is the history and the grandeur of the hotel overall. The location is also pretty special. Throw in a pool and a great Oceanside bar and it's pretty cool as an experience overall."	Date of stay: April 2017
2bstressfree	Amazing	"The hotel has all of the old world charm and the staff are the best part!!!..Sitting on the terrace overlooking the sea with a nice cold drink can not be beaten!!..The rooms are very nice, clean and spacious!..BUT the best thing about this place is the staff..could be the best hotel staff I have ever seen, helpful, courteous and nothing is too much trouble...Just stay here you wont regret it!!...The wifi is free, strong and works all over the hotel!"

Prop19	A charming hotel	"My wife and I only stayed at the Galle Face Hotel for one night before setting off to tour Sri Lanka, but it was delightful. The staff are incredibly friendly and the hotel is perfectly situated with some rooms having an ocean view. Breakfast is served on a beautiful terrace overlooking the beach."	Date of stay: March 2017
Caroline	Old World Charm	"Arriving at the hotel you see an ageing beauty, the foyer is beautiful with an amazing terracotta frieze and antique furnishings yet still bright and airy.  Check in was smooth and relaxed with a glass of ginger iced tea and a toy elephant for our daughter.  We were kindly upgraded to a Junior Suite with a small balcony overlooking the ocean. The rooms may have seen better days in the original part of the hotel but to us this just added to the charm of the stay. Original wooden floors, high ceilings and french doors to allow the Tradewinds to cool the room (although air conditioning was also a welcome relief!)  We enjoyed lunch by the pool overlooking the ocean. Would be nice to see more local dishes on the menu.  We had pre dinner drinks in the gorgeous colonial style"	Date of stay: April 2017
Z_Bran	Too many amazing things to say	"How can I explain this experience?   My family and I arrived, tired and hungry at the Galle Face hotel after riding in a small car for 5 hours. We were going to leave later that night. My first thoughts were 'holy cow'. The hotel is a huge old colonial hotel right next to the sea AND the city. The poolside view and the view from the assorted restaurants all show you a glimpse of the translucent ocean. When we first got inside, they offered us a 'Cinnamon and Ginger' juice that cured my motion sickness. As we were only staying for a night, they offered us the 'Empress Suite' which was a huge room around as big as an apartment. The room was very clean and offered high speed Wi-Fi.    Later, we went down for lunch at 'The Verandah' which offers an All-You-Can-Eat buffet which"	Date of stay: April 2017
Therese G	A taste of heritage in Colombo	Although this is one of the more expensive hotels in town it is worth it to stay in such a beautifully maintained heritage building. The breakfast was fabulous with endless choices served in a lovely outdoor terrace overlooking the ocean. Great service from all staff and good location for sightseeing in Colombo.	Date of stay: April 2017
Edward C	Fantastic for a short stay in Colombo	"We splashed out and stayed in a Premier Ocean Balcony room. We got room 2020, on the second floor, in the middle of the hotel overlooking the hotel bar, pool and beach. It was awesome! The hotel itself is a bit oldie-worldy, but the service, location and breakfast are all excellent andthe ocean-front pool and bar/dining areas would have to be better than anywhere else in the city. I'd definitely stay here again if coming back to Colombo."	Date of stay: April 2017
BXD786	Very nice colonial style place	Lovely hotel.  No real faults to moan about. Very clean and super great staff.  Buffet dinner was just OK in my view as the food was good but nothing wow (maybe because I hate buffets generally) Surprisingly the breakfast was excellent which is something I usually find bulk standard at all top hotels. This one though had the best croissants and other pastries to rival Europe. Overall great place.	Date of stay: April 2017
let's travel now	Next to the Indian Ocean	"This is beautiful colonial hotel directly next to the Indian Ocean and opposite the Galle Face Green.  On the other side of the hotel is Galle Road and this road is packed with traffic sounding their horns and is noisy to say the least.  It is a super busy hotel considered by many to be the number one hotel in Colombo and it is very busy with regards to social functions, meetings, weddings and social events.  The food and the service are excellent.  The car park and the road directly outside the hotel is frequently packed with cars and buses so entry and exit is often very very congested, set off early if you are attending a function.  Beautiful hotel, well worth a visit."	Date of stay: March 2017
64judith64	Colonial era charm	Our room was in the south wing and it was a lot smaller than expected.  The rollaway bed we needed meant an armchair and table had to be moved outside.  Bathroom was ok - separate bath and walk in shower although couldn't get hot water to work in bath.  We overlooked a fairly non descript building next door and could see a bit of ocean.  I think not booking directly with hotel did not help with room allocation! Hotel does have its charm though.  Liked the museum with Prince Philip's first car. The bar is great for a cocktail at sunset and cannot fault the breakfast choice.  Location is also good. Colombo is getting new high end hotels though which are nearing completion so they may have to look at another refurbishment soon for the rooms. The setting though is fabulous both for	Date of stay: April 2017

Unforgettable."	Date of stay: April 2017
Vachintha Piyadasa	Excellent	Undoubtedly one of the best hotels in the country. I've been here a number of times and my experience has been equally amazing.

One of my favorites and would definitely recommend to anyone.	Date of stay: December 2016
laura_peck	Impressive for such a big hotel	"My husband and I had a lovely stay at this hotel - we enjoyed the breakfast, had an attractive and clean room and were impressed by the fact that even though we were in a huge hotel, it never felt crowded. We felt that complementary water by the pool would have been a nice touch."	Date of stay: March 2017
pat2231	Impressive!!!	"This is an exceptional hotel. The staff are consistently excellent, knowledgeable, and gracious. The hotel building has a rich history and the conversion into a hotel has managed to retain much of the original charm. Beauty is everywhere, from the cosy furniture to the impressive art work and wonderful deco pieces and luxurious material. Food is out of this world. Would surely rank at one of the best experiences Colombo has to offer."	Date of stay: July 2016

Trusted_Wanderers	Lavish experience	"We capped our holiday in Sri Lanka by checking in to Galle Face Hotel in Colombo. The history of the hotel is quite interesting and has been in operation for more than a century.   The Pros:  The Suite: My husband booked the Oceanic Balcony Junior Suite but we were upgraded to The Empress Suite. It is massive! You can entertain at least 8 people at the dining table, and it has a large balcony that has both ocean and city (more towards city) view, 2 toilets, a pantry, complimentary drinks and snacks, comfortable king size bed and beautiful historic artworks. Staff: The staff are friendly and welcoming. We were greeted by a lovely lady in saree who was kind and polite. She handled all our check-in procedures are guided us to the room.  The Cons:  The Welcome: We saw a few people"	Date of stay: January 2017

Oakworthgirl	More than just a bar snack	"We popped in on Sunday noon to have lunch here in one of Colombo's most beautiful colonial establishments.  Upon walking into the reception area, we were transformed into the grandeur and atmosphere of a more glamourous age  And even though we were hot, sweaty and wearing shorts and t-shirts, we were greeted like honoured guests as we enquired directions to The Veranda restaurant. However, as it was Sunday, they were serving a brunch buffet which wasn't to start for another half and hour and at £20 was more than we needed to spend and eat.  So instead we sat in outside in the porch area of the bar, right by the ocean and it was lovely.  After a few refreshing drinks we ordered from the limited choice from the bar snacks menu.  I had the club sandwich and hubby had the vegetable"	Date of stay: March 2017

On our second night, there was an event below our room and the front desk where very accommodating and moved us to one of their bigger suites so that we did not have to listen to the music until 11pm.

Staff were very attentive.   However, the rooms are small and maintenance could be improved.  Our party thought the mattresses were terrible, but I didn't think that. Oh, note that the 4th floor is a smoking floor (we got those rooms without even being notified about it)"	Date of stay: March 2017

The amazing staff, especially the chief concierge, Emanuel were so helpful, even when we struggled to get out train tickets before arriving in Sri Lanka, Emanuel went down on his day off and fixed it for us!! They helped us get around Colombo, with our bookings at the Ministry of crab and when our boy wasn't feeling well they all showed sincere support in ensuring he was well looked after! The hotel property and rooms are beautiful, the colonial decor and style, charming with  a touch of class ????????"	Date of stay: March 2017

We took this hotel as start to a round trip on this awsome island, to gain power after the long approach from europe. Unfortunally the spa was closed due to construction, and the hotel offers celebration hall, which was occupied the first night; therefore ""only"" 4 of 5 points;  but still, there is an outdoor pool, beautifull rooms with really really cool bathrooms and we would totally recommand this hotel for everyone looking for a nice, cosy, but still ambient interior."

We were the only people arriving at the hotel but the staff were quick to check us in, offer a welcome drink and whisk us off to our rooms to rest. We spent two further nights at the hotel - spending two full days in Colombo.  The breakfast buffet was excellent, and we all agreed this was the best we had in Sri Lanka as there was plenty of choice - the string hoppers and chicken curry was my favourite! We had dinner in the terrace restaurant one night, and dinner at Sea Spray the second night. Both were excellent, prices about similar to what you would pay in the UK.   We had two premier"	Date of stay: March 2017

Every member of staff has a sunny smile when you pass and they match their happy exteriors with professional, indeed excellent, service.  The food is comprehensive enough to satisfy all tastes and is as delicious as its beautiful presentation suggests.   Most remarkable of all, though, was the quality of the support. At the very moment of my arrival, I suffered a chronic nosebleed that required immediate attention  and hospitalization. The hotel staff spared no effort to ensure that the medical response (ambulance etc) was as prompt, as appropriate and as efficient as it could be.

This historic hotel has hosted many celebrities including Mark Twain, Queen Elizabeth II, Stephen Spielberg, and many other notable individuals. Most of the rooms have views of the Indian Ocean. The rooms are well appointed with modern finishes. The service and dining are good with exotic fare as well as what will be familiar to western taste. Cheap tuktul tranportation is available for the adventuresome, costing two to for dollars for up to three passengers. Taxi's are also available, but the Tuktuks get through the heavy traffic more efficiently."	Date of stay: March 2017
Richard K	Nice Spot for a Cool Drink on a Hot Day	"After a 3 Km walk on a hot and humid day, I was very happy to sit down and have a very refreshing glass of ginger and cranberry juice with ice - highly recommended. As with most 5 star hotels, the drink itself was overpriced, but if you include the ocean view, the colonial surroundings and the service it is not bad value."	Date of stay: March 2017
JaneVictoria	Disappointing start	"We were looking forward to this hotel, the last of seven magnificent stays in Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, we (17 of us) were given VERY average rooms (small, dark and depressing) and it took our wonderful guide, Amara, to intervene on our behalf to get better results.  We were then moved to appropriate rooms, nice views and comfortable furnishings. The staff, including the manager, just didn't want to hear our complaints, though lovely Ivonni did try to help initially. On the plus side, the pool (sea water) was fabulous, breakfast delicious in a superb setting, emotional experience of a piper at sunset and a delightful bar area. The hotel car was excellent, nice driver and cheap rates. Staff in the dining areas were helpful and efficient."	Date of stay: February 2017

jmc303	Colonial elegance	Stayed here both ends of our holiday. Staff are very attentive. Rooms are what you would expect from a hotel of this class. Breakfast is such a lovely experience. Food choices plenty. Swimming pool is big enough. A very enjoyable stay. 2 tips. Don't bother with the tuk tuk drivers outside the hotel. They are only there to rip you off. Just hail a tuk tuk as one drives by. You do not need to visit the airport 5 hours before departure. It took less than an hour to get through. And with 2 hours to go to our flight there was nobody queueing to check in at all.	Date of stay: February 2017

Is it perfect? No, but does perfection really exist? I don't believe it does. The hotels renovation has allowed in the 21st century for travellers to step back to a bygone era. I look forward to many many more happy stays at Galle Face Hotel.  I'm delighted to have signed in the Big Book. If you're able to view it, its a fascinating history of the hotel.

Recommend this as a good way to end an itinerary. 4 days is good but honestly could have stayed longer. Firstly the room:  We had a premier, sea view room with balcony room 2041 in the North Wing. The North wing is really the best of the choices though the whole hotel  is lovely and it has recently been refurbished to a high standard. We do recommend the north wing and be sure to choose this  room type as a minimum - its well worth it if you are staying for any length of time....and be sure you have this agreed in advance. The room itself is very nice and the balcony is large. Service is first class, though can be a little slow with drinks if you are in the bars...but hey whats the hurry."	Date of stay: March 2017

Sakilla	Feeling of Old Glory	"I loved this hotel. Just imagine yourself 100 years back. The interiors and authentic old floors were very nice. Rooms were nice and clean and AC was working as it should – you did not notice. Swimming-pool on the beach was enjoyable as the dinner with the sound of waves. The breakfast was absolutely gorgeous:  fresh juice, all kind of coffees, Asian food, European food – everything in place and very nicely presented. The service was also excellent, polite and helpful. Hotel is in the centre of Colombo and it is very easy to take a tuk-tuk and let you drive for sight-seeing or shopping. The airport transfer is also available. I have previously stayed in Hilton and Taj Samudra in Colombo, these were very good too, but the atmosphere of Galle Face was the best for me."

The fantasy was soon shattered by stepping into a decaying facility with spotty service. Arriving at 3 am after a 24 hour journey, we registered and proceeded to the room accompanied by chatty ""assistants."" We wanted to sleep; they wanted to educate us about the hotel. Upon opening the door to the room, we were greeted by a huge bath tub in the middle of the room. You read that correctly! The oddest sight among many odd sights. After the complete tutorial, I discovered it was impossible to turn out all the lights and simply have a night light. Thankfully I had my eye shades.  The room was void of appeal -- all brown, uncomfortable, sparse amenities, etc. The morning light"	Date of stay: March 2017
CuriousSeeker65	Charming colonial hotel	We spent our first couple of nights here. Were upgraded to a suite with a balcony overlooking the ocean. Absolutely magical from the view to the four poster bed to the bathroom with huge tub. Service was superb. Food was very good with a selection of restaurants. Loads of old world charm. Was about a 45 minute drive from the airport at night. I was very happy we'd chosen it over a more modern hotel.   We arrived on my birthday and the hotel had a delicious cake waiting in our room. Such attention to detail. Highly recommend it. Would stay here again.	Date of stay: March 2017
wayne S	"Beautiful, old world hotel"	"Lovely hotel, with an ocean front location.  We had a room with a nice ocean view and a rather large balcony which also faced the outdoor restaurant area and the evening bagpiper.  Reasonable prices and excellent service and a very good all you can eat buffet."	Date of stay: February 2017
duncan m	First night in Sri Lanka	Impressive hotel which retains a unique old colonial character. Well located by the sea and wonderful promenade which is sadly being eroded by insensitive towering and two overbearing hotel towers under construction by the Chinese. Rooms are comfortable and well appointed but ours suffered from drain odours from the bathroom which accounts for a drop in the review score. Only had breakfast which was excellent. Bar and terrace is very pleasant place to pass time.	
B1104BBdaveh	Very pleased	"I believe GFH is one of the best hotels in the world and I have stayed in very many. You have great style as well as comfort, luxury and great service. Your ""front of house"" is outstanding, congratulations."	
melaniep88	Beautiful seafront hotel with charm but disappointing service	My family & I were disappointed by the service we received on arrival. We had just endured a 7-hour van journey & the check in process was unnecessarily long & painful & took at least half an hour! After finally being seen to our rooms we noticed that the two triple rooms that we had booked were not set up for the third person & were far too small to comfortably fit a third bed in. After complaining we finally moved to new rooms after an hour or so and unfortunately had to split away from the rest of our group. This lack of service ruined our experience. The hotel itself is beautiful and in a great location & the food was excellent.	Date of stay: February 2017
TransConFlyer	"Tired and run down, but good food"	"The Galle Face Hotel is long past its prime and now primarily serves mid-range tour groups. Located approximately 40 minutes from Colombo airport by car, it has a beautiful seaside setting with amazing views. However, the building and furnishings are in need of complete renovation: broken-down lounge chairs around the pool, a loose step at the bottom of the stairs (don't fall), stains nicks and gouges on pretty much everything.  No fitness or spa facilities whatsoever during my stay: one staff member said there was a maintenance emergency, but a management letter claimed renovations. None of this was explained before arrival.  Avoid the Oceanic Balcony Junior Suite room category. Immediately upon walking in is the large tub (no divider, no privacy, no curtain), which in turn"	Date of stay: March 2017
katiee_overseas	"Spectacular location, historic building"	"The rooms vary at this hotel, but I was in a huge one in the newer part. The room was comfortable and spacious, but you don't spend much time in it, because the view of the ocean from the terrace and bar is lovely. And, how many hotels have an in-hotel museum, and a resident bagpiper?"	Date of stay: October 2016

Trine D	Disappointed	"We stayed here one night, as the last night before flying home. We stayed two adults and a 1,5 yr old.  The staff greeting us was very friendly and helpful.   Around 10p.m. the most awful loud music started playing. It was extreme, I'm trying not to exaggerate, but the painting and mirrors were vibrating on the wall and you could feel the bass on the floor. We stayed on the third floor (room 3072), and it turned out that some kind of (fashion?) show was going on on the ground floor. I must imagine the music would have been worse for the people staying below us. We confronted he management in the reception right away, that guaranteed that the music would stop 11.30p.m, and that they have been told to turn it down. He offered us to change rooms, but we declined, as our baby was"	Date of stay: March 2017

CustardV	Last stop before the airport	"My husband had chosen for us to stay here for the last 2 nights of our 3 week holiday so that we would be comfortable and clean before flying home.  The first thing I noticed was the lovely clean 30m swimming pool so I was happy! Even happier to get in and realise it was heated slightly.  The hotel is absolutely huge and has fairly recently had a makeover.  Our room was perfectly nice and clean, but you could have been in any good hotel in the world. No old colonial charm has remained.  Breakfast was a very impressive buffet and overlooked the crashing waves (and a member of staff trying to catapult the local crow menaces).  Watching the sunset was lovely and they make quite a thing of it by lowering the flag and playing bagpipes.  We arranged a taxi for the airport through the"	Date of stay: March 2017

Rob S	"Although they try, this hotel misses the 5-star mark."	"The hotel has done a brilliant job with the renovation of the common areas, however the front desk staff were the only staff that made this feel like a 5-star hotel.   It's the little things, like dirty windows/doors in common areas, to any sort of food or drink order taking upwards to 45-minutes with a massive amount of staff appearing like they are all busy, yet nothing is getting done. At a 5-star hotel, guests should not have to spend 10 minutes trying to waive down staff for a menu.   On the positive side, the property itself is gorgeous, with a beautifully landscaped pool and outdoor restaurant. I would recommend spending extra to get a Premiere Room, as Superior Rooms do not appear to be renovated, and both Superior and Landmark don't guarantee views (which could mean an"	Date of stay: March 2017

Eli B	Amazing place to decelerate	"THe exposure of this estate is exhilarating set steps from the Indian Ocean.  On a scorching summer day there's nothing more appealing than ordering a cocktail or two while lounging by the pool.   Lounging is the operative word here, because the ocean saps your energy.

Piglet47	A fitting end to a wonderful holiday	"This was our last stopping off point before returning home and it did not disappoint. Service, room and all amenities were very good.

Emma L	Wonderful hotel - but be aware of tourist scams and gem rackets	"I loved everything about the hotel and would definitely choose Galle Face again should I return to Colombo. One thing I wished the hotel would inform us was how you, as an obvious tourist, get ATTACKED outside the hotel by friendly people asking you where your from, how long your staying and then telling you, you're in luck! This is your happy day! Just get in this tuktuk and he'll take you to a temple and then the yearly Gem sale (only today!). They guide you through the temple in such a hurry, telling you where to stand and pushing you around for photo ops then takes you shopping for gems (we didn't ask to) and then another store where they follow you inside making sure you shop. We had some other shopping plans but he never drove us there, told us our options were expensive"	Date of stay: February 2017

Tibbs0675	Classic but pricey!	The location of the hotel is good. The old colonial building itself is impressive. The majority of staff were helpful and pleasant. Watching the sunset on the terrace is nice. The room and part of the hotel we were located in smelt of drains.  The swimming pool area is smaller than it looks in the photos.  This is an expensive hotel for Sri Lanka - but I guess you are paying a lot more due to it's historic status and the fact it's in a capital city.   The breakfast wasn't that nice (I felt a little sick afterwards) and the chef cooking the eggs was unfriendly and rude. Not sure if we'd ever return to this hotel but pleased we got to stay in such a historic and beautiful building.	Date of stay: February 2017
alittlelizzy	Quintessential Galle Face Hotel	What a wonderful piece of history - this delightful colonial hotel stay. The staff were so incredibly helpful and polite at all times and made our stay so much more enjoyable.   We started our stay in a room that was somewhat less than expected - we had a sea view however due to the spray and  moist air the room was damp.  On explaining this the manager was ever so accommodating and made every effort to help us.  Our next 2 nights stay in the Common Wealth Suite was just perfect! Thank you.	Date of stay: November 2016

The situation is glorious - so close to the sea you could almost believe you're on a ship. Lovely, well-appointed rooms which have all mod cons despite the old world feel of the stairs and landings. Great salt water swimming pool, excellent beach bar, and the highlight must be the superb Seaspray restaurant which serves the freshest, tastiest fish on the island. The buffet restaurant was a little disappointing, although the breakfasts there were excellent. All the staff are delightful, smiling and ever helpful.

Bang	Crazy din of TWO weddings that lasted until 11.30pm	"I had booked this hotel as a treat for my wife during our honeymoon in Sri Lanka. We were really happy with the beautiful exteriors but our delight was definitely short-lived. We checked in late at around 8pm but had to wait more than twenty minutes for our room to be ready. That didn't dampen our moods as we were both thrilled to learn that our room was at the newly renovated wing. Upon reaching our room, we found a garment left behind by the previous guest in the wardrobe, which we politely rang the reception to collect. The real straw that broke the camel's back was the loud thumping music that came from the function room just doors away. Moments later, there was sounds of music from the bagpipes adding onto the din from another room. I find it ridiculous that a hotel that"	Date of stay: March 2017

We had a wonderful room with a huge balcony overlooking the ocean and possibly the best shower we have had in any hotel ever! The food was very good and the staff mostly excellent- but see below. Our only minor criticism was that our stay coincided with a jazz festival the hotel was staging . There were no issues whatsoever with noise, but there were no notices displayed about the effect on hotel guests, i.e. That one restaurant was closed and at one point we were refused entrance by the festival security team because the hotel had neglected to give us the required wrist bands ."

The staff, whoever it is, is very friendly and all very attentive to the guests. When you pass someone of them, you always get a smile back. The restaurants are just wonderful, whether it is the Seafood restaurant, The Verandah (where you start the morning with a yummy breakfast) or the terrace with the view to the Indian Ocean. To take a sundowner there is something really special. We love this hotel and will definitely come back one day. It is one of the best hotels in the world."	Date of stay: January 2017

On arrival, the general staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was ok, though it was probably one of the more basic rooms we'd stayed in throughout our trip in Sri Lanka (which we'd booked on a budget) - it was not what we expected for the price we paid. However, the hotel is fairly centrally located (though Colombo is generally quite a spread out city).   After dinner on our first night, we were told via a letter posted under our door that a jazz festival was to be held at the hotel that weekend for two days. The jazz festival took up most of the green space and a large stage was erected which blocked most of our"	Date of stay: February 2017
Coop2015	A grand old hotel full of history...and a little tired	"This is my fifth stay at Galle Face Hotel - the first was ten years ago and I've been visiting every few years ever since. The history and grandeur of the place are wonderful, but despite a recent refurb the hotel itself looks tired in places and the small details need to have more attention.  Beach/sun lounger towels with holes in them, interiors and exteriors looking slightly run down, paint samples across the walls outside the gym and discarded furniture for presumably an impending completion of the refurb, and the staff still have the level of service of 10 years ago - slow and inflexible.   Wonderful location and it'll always have a special place in my heart as well as Sri Lankan history...but they need to get with the times to justify charging such inflated prices."

SofiaDahlgren	Wonderful!	"Everything was great. Views, pool, buffet, hotel, rooms. I have just one complaint and it is about the waiters in the restaurant. They would need to improve their service. Hostess should follow the guest to the table and not just say ""take the 7th table over there!!"", waiters could be more service minded. I ordered some additional cheese for my breakfast and when I ordered two types the waiter told me ""2 cheeses? Thats too much."" And I said please give me just little of each so I can try. He just walked away and didn't say anything serving me the cheese. I ordered a cesar sallad at the pool bar and it took 40 minutes. I also had to remind the waiter about my sallad and it seemed like he had forgotten as in 2 minutes he showed up with my sallad. Room service also took too long"

Lots of history and a little museum on site showing whos stayed there.  Our room was small but clean  , nice toiletries.  Think the minibar should have had free drinks in but ours was empty. Made use of the lovely outside bar instead on the seafront. Saw the lowering of the flag with the bagpipe player! Ate at the italian restaurant and had a lovely meal there. Breakfast was excellent with lots of choice and even fizz if you wanted it. Pool bar did nice food to.  Swimming pool area is small but always had sunbeds free as people seemed to come and go and not sit there all day.

Neathoak	Colonial Elegance	"Stayed 3 nights in an Ocean Suite.  Superb view of the sea crashing in onto the beach.  We love the sound of the sea so the noise didn't bother us,  but can imagine some may be kept awake by it.  The room was old and full of character - nothing was quite straight. Again, can imagine some may be put off by this, but for us, it just smacks of authenticity.  By choosing a suite, this gave us access to the Long Bar, serving complimentary breakfast and evening cocktails, as well as tea and coffee all day.  The hotel itself is a real throwback to colonial days.  The Traveller's Bar is a cooling verandah, the pool bar has a lovely view of the ocean and the sea food restaurant had excellent food.

However, the stay was ruined by the Hotel hosting the Sri Lanka Blues and Jazz Festival.  What were they thinking?  A serene and relaxing stay was interrupted by ear-piercing music played well past midnight on the first night and after 10.30 on the second night.  The public was invited into the hotel and so it was over-crowded and messy.  After complaining about the inconvenience and the horrific noise after the first night, the hotel offered to move us to another hotel.  This did not suit us as were leaving the next morning.

The Travellers Bar and Verandah are lovely spots for weary travellers (look out for the photos of all the famous guests), and the cocktail menu with its detailed descriptions was a treat. We loved walking out directly onto Galle Face Green and mingling with the kite fliers and locals in the early evening. We also walked to the"	Date of stay: February 2017
Cindy P	A piece of history	"Lovely old colonial hotel and a must visit if you are in Colombo. Traditional rooms with all modern facilities, nice bar overlooking the water for a cool glass of fizz whilst sun setting. Interesting museum on people that have visited the hotel over the years with prince Philips car, quirky ritual of piping down the flag at sunset. Service a bit hot and miss and breakfast was chaos. Down side, as this is a bit of a tourist attraction streams of people come through to look around and the place looses that exclusivity and relaxing atmosphere. Worth a visit but not sure I would stay here again."	Date of stay: February 2017

trez8181	Amazing colonial era hotel with top notch service	"I stayed four nights at the Galle Face Hotel while on work travel. Wow, what a gem this hotel is. The hotel is on the ocean just south of the Galle Face Green. It just drips with colonial era charm...the huge veranda restaurant overlooking the water was a favorite spot. The hotel also has interesting features including a museum with a classic car and photos of famous guests (from Mark Twain to Scarlett Johansson), library, and endless spots to sit & relax. The pool is nice and also overlooks the water, and is a perfect spot to watch the sunset. My room was large and well-appointed, and the bed was comfortable. The hotel staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. You owe it to yourself to spend a night at the Galle Face Hotel if you're in Colombo."	Date of stay: January 2017

stevebuick	As Good As It Gets (Almost)	"I have been staying at the Galle Face Hotel for 20 years and was worried the recent refurbishment might have dulled the previously deeply atmospheric grandeur. I'm pleased to say the grandeur is still there with enough of it's former colonial ambience still intact. It's a great pity the board bearing the impressive list of Hollywood, literary and royal patronage is no longer on display in the lobby, along with the busts of Yuri Gagarin and Arthur C Clarke (who lived in Colombo, often writing within the walls of the hotel).  There is another issue that needs to be mentioned (and to me it's a big one). I feel there is no place in such an establishment for regular bar-style live music. The sounds of the crows and the lapping ocean is the perfect and only soundtrack that should be"

Darghan	Best hotel in Sri Lanka	"This is a great hotel which is beautifully maintained.  Rooms are spacious, clean, quiet and with good bathrooms. The colonial theme is carried throughout the hotel in both the rooms and public spaces. Great breakfast and service is second to none. The hotel has a history room, which celebrates the hotel's past. Beautiful grounds, pool and outlook. Walking distance to most attractions. Wanted to move in."	Date of stay: February 2017

Nilma P	Honeymoon... 1 day 2 night visit to Colombo	"My husband and I picked the Galle Face as we were recommended by a friend to stay there for its renowed colonial, charming character. We loved being treated like royalty. So Prince Philip, Roger Moore, Richard Nixon, Harrison Ford all stayed there. It is worth going on the guided tour of the hotel or looking around yourself, there is a library and a museum. I would describe it as a very tranquil hotel being by the sea with our own private sea front. Watching the sun set into the sea was amazing. We loved the champaine breakfast every morning and the attentative staff all over the hotel. I would def stay here again and recommend to others, its a 10 out of 10 for me. I would also recommend that you get a taxi down the road to The Kingsbury and dine in one of their resturants and a"	Date of stay: February 2017
Tramper13	Step back in time	"We only stayed for two nights at the Galle Face Hotel, because our stay in Colombo was only two days, and that was not enough to fully appreciate this magnificent hotel, which is kept (or at least seems to be) in the style of the early part of the century. Everything about this hotel is stylish and you would not be disappointed."	Date of stay: January 2017
Charles-Joint	Totally luxurious and fabulous	We were only here for one night and upgraded to a suit! Location overlooking the sea lovely.

If you are visiting Colombo spoil yourself here.	Date of stay: February 2017
Irene H	Old style elegance and charm	We had a very brief visit to this hotel on 1st February. The room was old world but updated to the current standards.

vwi2017	An Uncommon Experience	"It isn't that the rooms are spectacular or ""cushy"" - they are elegant but not indulgent.  It is the sum total of everything experienced at the Galle Face Hotel that makes the experience memorable.  From the exquisite location to the historic architecture; from the flawless attention of staff to the elegance of every dining experience; from check-in to check-out, a night at the Galle Face Hotel is an experience in beauty and excellence.  If you're looking for ""dazzle"" you won't find it.  If you are looking for simple elegance, quiet attention, or easeful rest as you step back in time to Sri Lanka's colonial past, you can't miss this experience.  The hotel staff has done a magnificent job of maintaining an air of modern luxury while preserving the beauty and elegance of the past."

Dinner at the Seaspray Restaurant overlooking the ocean, really good barramundi. Then cocktails at the hotel 'pub' In on the Green where there was also live music. Stored our luggage the next morning while we went seeing the sights and then came back for lunch at the pool bar before we left. Nothing to complain about. Just a shame we missed the sunset at Galle Face Green but that was down to the runway repairs at the airport which meant our flight arrived later than originally scheduled."

Nice pool, several nice restaurants, superb location at the seafront. The only thing you have to check is to which room you are booked because there is quite a difference als we learned. First room we got was 3027, a room with view over the roof to the city, room was not big but ok. Probleem was the that the kitchen exhaust pipe was juist outside the window, making à lot of noise. We asiel to change and got 3030, same site room, same view, no exhaust. Bed comfortable, spacious bathroom, good WiFi.

We had high tea with a view of the seafront & the sun setting, against the sounds of acoustic guitars playing in the background. It was lovely. Iced coffee was a bit too milky & sweet for me, but you don't visit colombo for coffee! Worth a trip just for the experience. High tea per person cost about LKR1,500 (incl tax). Nice selection of savouries (chicken mayo with a slight turmeric flavouring), the usual cheese & cucumber sandwiches, vege puff pastry, cakes, scones & other sweets."	Date of stay: February 2017
TariqM	Overwhelming food and great presentation	Visited with a bunch of friends at the terrace by the sea which is a great and relaxing location. We ordered different types of food and the taste was fabulous. We were so thrilled on the food offerings and the way it was presented with a lot of workmenship by the kitchen staff. Happened to come across Exec. Chef Prasanna and Chef de Cusine Anurudhdha  who were the key architects for food in this hotel. Both of them were very hospitable and very helpful which displays a lot of focused customer care. Must also thank the service staff and manager of the outlet for the consistency of great service offered.  I highly recommend this hotel and it's food quality which brings in a lot of value for money. Thank you all!	Date of stay: February 2017

scottl888888	Great hotel	"My wife and I stayed here at the end of our honeymoon. We found the hotel itself to be amazing with colonial charm, great comfortable rooms with everything per advertising. We found the service in most areas lacking, perhaps  because my partner and I are young. But we found little things, like a good morning, an employee holding the door open after they had walked through, asking how our room was lacking. When we checked out, the person doing this did not even query how our stay was, whether we would recommend or had any feedback.   When checking in we had a few issues also, they charged us for the stay in its entirety without notifying either of us, we also had to wait for our room to be ready, which for an establishment of this standard is poor."

The staff is very friendly, when we were their we were late for lunch and the area was about to close but they allowed us to have lunch...it was very nice of them becuase they know how to keep a customer happy. Rooms are well maintained and very cleaned. Food is very tasty as always."	Date of stay: December 2016
Roshana V	Incredible stay	Stayed here on and off in January. It was wonderful.  My partner and I were able to stay in one of the recently rennovated rooms and it was beautiful. The breakfast in the morning was incredible and included champagne! The views were stunning and the communal areas were beautiful.  The staff were very attentive and courteous. If you want to be spoiled I'd highly recommend it.	Date of stay: January 2017
Campbell T	Grand Hotel from the Days of Empire	"Despite the fact that quite a lot of the hotel is relatively new, it has the air of the British Empire and the (relatively) new additions are almost indistinguishable from the oldest parts.  Rooms are large and airy - well ours was, a least.  We would only have a couple of criticisms, both of which are management related.  Firstly, housekeeping was patchy - beds were made and the place was clean, but the tea-making facilities were forgotten about, as was the provision of bottled water: important when the tap water shouldn't be drunk by non-locals due to Ph levels.  Secondly, while there were a lot of staff, they weren't necessarily well trained or managed.  In this case, less might have been more. Finally, if you work (or tour) through to mid-afternoon, and want to have a meal,"	Date of stay: January 2017
Rob M	Breathtaking	"If you want to be spoiled come here. I have rarely seen so many couples looking happy. If there is any romance in you this is the place to be.   Breakfast on the veranda overlooking the lawns and the ocean. Sipping the complimentary french champagne.  Expansive array of foods and the egg hoppers are perfect.  People actually talking to each other rather than staring at their ipads.   Other end of the day by the pool watching the sun set shimmering over the water. A G+T in hand of course.  Accompanied by a slightly kitsch piper and flag officer lowering the national flag.   Not cheap but extremely good value. My room is a suite, no view to speak of as I booked very late and it is full. Tge room has everything and nothing short of opulent.   Spoil yourselves"	Date of stay: February 2017

Dimi R	Great hotel and even better location!	"This is an amazing hotel with a lot of history. Our room was well appointed.

The Verandah restaurant has great food options too."	Date of stay: February 2017
Emma D	Very enjoyable stay	Everything was as you would expect with a few extra touches. V helpful staff and delicious food for our last night in Sri Lanka.

Linda H	Wonderful old hotel	"This hotel has been renovated beautifully.  They have kept the charm of the old hotel, but modernized the rooms so they are comfortable.

The original pool water came right from the ocean."	Date of stay: January 2017

GeraldineGer	Colonial feel wonderful feel	"Staying at Galle Face Hotel was one of the highlights of our trip. From the outside facade to inside the hotel, the colonial feel wowed us, and this hotel has so much history and is maintained very well. The rooms are cosy, and the beds are very comfortable. The best part is the swimming pool area that's by the beach. Take a book and sit by the pool and watch the waves crashing by is one of the most relaxing activities. And you can catch a beautiful sunset. The hotel even has a museum inside where you can view a vintage car and see the many celebrities who have stayed here. I love the small touches such as the big bouquets of lilies at the lobby, which brightens up the area and has a nice smell. Highly recommended to stay here and you will not regret it!"

David C	A Superb hotel for a first night in Sri Lanka	"We choose this famous historic hotel for our first night in Sri Lanka and have decided to return on our last night.  Room was very good, evening buffet in the semi open air terrace restaurant was one of the very best we have had with particularly good local dishes. Breakfast was excellent too. Service from all staff was outstanding and with no quibble let us have a late check out until 1pm. Has a nice pool overlooking the sea too. This plus its location,  history, museum and evocative old photos makes it an excellent and for us with our booking through Trip Advisor  an excellent value choice."	Date of stay: February 2017
SorHald	Fantastic luxury hotel	"Spent 5 nights ending our Sri Lanka honeymoon on this beautyful hotel in Colombo, where we relaxed by the pool and enjoyed the warm and professionel service by the hotel staff. As most reviews will tell, this is an old hotel that is newly renovated with respect for its heritage, and has so much more personality and cozyness than never modern 5-stars hotels. Would definetly recommend, and if I ever come back to Colombo, I would stay here again."	Date of stay: January 2017
Aquarius57	Charming	"We really enjoyed our stay at this historic hotel, great location and staff, we will definitely return.  The refurbishment has retained and enhanced the hotels character, we had a fabulous corner sea front room which overlooked Galle Face Green and the sea. The food we ate there was excellent, if your eating breakfast at peak time the restaurant couldn't accommodate all guests and so we had a small wait for a table and it was a bit too busy, on the last day of our stay we ate about 7am and it was very pleasant. My only feedback to management is that the staff are excellent but the restaurant and bar area could have benefited from some leadership/guidance."	Date of stay: January 2017

Historic, famous old colonial style hotel that at one time or another has hosted many famous world leaders and celebrities. Although completely upgraded for the present day it has not lost its historic roots. Stayed in a premier sea view room with balcony. Great position, huge balcony but room itself small compared with some we've enjoyed throughout the vacation. Pool area very good, though busy when we were there. Service all very good too, if a tad on the slow side, whilst the dinner and breakfast buffets are the best buffets we've had (where buffets were the standard offering) during the whole holiday. Price of everything very reasonable considering the class of the hotel.   No complaints and wouldn't hesitate returning or"	Date of stay: February 2017

It's colonial charm, great people (especially Chief Concierge Emmanual), warm and friendly staff, great location on the beach and next to Galle Green made it the hotel we would return to again and again.  We came and went three times to the hotel as we traveled to Kandy and the interior, then struck out again to Galle and the south using Galle Face as our base.  Stayed in three different types of rooms and all were very comfortably furnished in colonial style.  The dining and gin & tonics sitting on the verandah with the sea breeze were great.  We look forward to going back."	Date of stay: January 2017

The buffet breakfast was great with plenty of Chandon on hand so a lovely way to start ones day.

Prudy N	Historic but not worth it	"I was excited to stay in this historic hotel.  I knew it was expensive but I thought it would be a fun experience.  Not so much....  I had arranged for them to have car pick us up at airport.  We waited.  No one came.  We finally got a taxi.  When I complained at checkin and told the clerk to please make sure I wasn't charged, he completely dismissed me by saying it was my travel agent's fault, not theirs.  I told them I didn't have a travel agent and that I had communicated directly with their management.  He dismissed the idea and said no, it was a third party and they weren't responsible.  Finally I was able to pull up the email string and show him.  No apology.  Just an ""oh, you haven't been charged.""    While this discussion was going on, we were brought a ""welcome"" glass"	Date of stay: January 2017
ArtistatParis	Be careful while walking outside of the hotel	"Every time you go out to have a walk around, someone suddenly happens to walk just beside you and introduces himself as the one who's working at the hotel! Then tells you that today is the special holidays and some shops somewhere are having sales. Never trust these guys! They all have the same scenario to empty your wallet! I stayed at the hotel 3 days and it happened for me everyday with a different person but same scenario!"	Date of stay: January 2017

The staff are hospitable and welcoming. The price to stay in Galle Face is quite high, I think it is due to it being a historical site. the other problem of being historical is the wooden floors in the south wing where when everyone moves outside the room you can here them, the worst noises were in room 2048 so avoid this room as it is under the stairs and nest to the worker storage.

I have stayed at the hotel before however it was many years ago however it is still as beautiful and colonial as before with great views over the shoreline. The terrace where breakfast is served is stunning, and the food absolutely faultless, one of the best hotel breakfasts we have had! I cannot recommend more, the prices are not extortionate either for a 5* hotel. Our only regret was that we could not stay longer but we will definitely be coming back on our next trip to Sri Lanka."

The foyer is also quite nice - well lit, spacious and at the time we were there it had a tall white Christmas tree. The staff are hospitable and welcoming. The price to stay in Galle Face is quite high, I think it is due to it being a historical site.   The room we had was very spacious, clean, and air conditioned. There are living rooms on each floor of the hotel which give it a nice historical feel and there are various nooks and crannies to explore. There is a small gym with treadmills and weights. There is also a spa in the same area and a salt water pool with a bar. They do not have an do-it-yourself laundry.

Martin D	Probably the best stop off in Colombo	We spent three nights here at the start of our Sri Lanka holiday. The hotel is overlooking the sea next to Galle Green which is no more than a brown expanse between the sea and a busy road.  We had a sea view room with a spacious balcony which was well worth the extra although without a sun shade we took breakfast in the restaurant downstairs. We ate twice at the hotel's sea food restaurant Sea Spray which was first class as was the swimming pool at the waters edge. The hotel enjoys a unique position as a result of which we doubt whether there is a better hotel in Colombo despite the constant stream of weddings and corporate events which the hotel hosts.

The ambience is excellent. It is such a beautiful building & well looked after. We enjoyed the luxury but it wax a sharp contrast to some of the poverty we saw.  The meals on the verandah were excellent & there is prompt service. The staff are always willing to please & helpful.  The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. The highlights were an excellent shower, complimentary snacks & drinks in fridge, king single beds in twin room.  I will definitely stay there again!"	Date of stay: January 2017

vontoby	A very nice hotel and option in Colombo	"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel. Although our room was small (we only paid for a fairly basic room), it was well maintained and we were lucky enough to get a view of the water and garden area below. It's a 19th century building (or the oldest parts are) and has a wonderful sense of its colonial past with its general design and the old, polished floorboards.  It has a pleasant pool area (30 metre pool) just above the waves crashing in from the sea and has a good breakfast buffet with quality food and service. My only slight reservation was with the bar near the pool - the cocktails were so weak I wouldn't bother with them and would just choose wine (if you can afford it) or beer. Nevertheless, if we return to Colombo we will definitely stay there again."	Date of stay: January 2017
kayshu01	Colonial Splendor	"Stayed 3 nights over the Christmas holidays in one of the newly refurbished rooms and enjoyed our stay.  The rooms are clean and beautifully decorated with porcelain bedside lamps and a small but adequate bathroom.  The room however, seemed quite small and we had a view of the roof of the rest of the hotel which faces Galle Road. The included breakfast, served on the terrace was sumptuous and had an extensive variety of Sri Lankan and Western options. We left some luggage as we went out of Colombo and returned 2 days later.  Somehow, the luggage tags were missing from the bags and we had to come in an identify our bags.  It seemed like a little hiccup but it was strange that the left luggage lost its tags!!  I gave them a 4/5 for that reason."	Date of stay: December 2016

Globetrotter	Grand Dame	"Colonial style hotel that transports you back to another century, despite my late arrival I received a hospitable welcome and was served a refreshing beverage and snack during check in. I had a lovely suite with a large balcony over looking the beach, located in the renovated wing of the hotel, suite was SPACIOUS with a HUGE bedroom good size bathroom and living area area, am a relatively light sleeper and I could hear the sounds of the ocean and thought that it may keep me awake however the total opposite I slept very well. Breakfasr is served on the verandah and is buffet style with a lot of options including the famous egg hoppers,  good sized pool to laze away the day and then at sunset sipping gin and tonics as you watch the flag lowering ceremony complete with bag"	Date of stay: January 2017

Kewgirl	Afternoon Decadence in The Travellers Bar	It has long been my ambition to spend an afternoon in the Travellers Bar in The Galle Face Hotel.  Today I have been spent a wonderful afternoon sipping a delicious Margarita (or two) & being looked after impeccably by my waiter CW!  It has been a magical experience & I will think back to my moment here in the years ahead and remember today with a smile!  I have been informed that The Galle Face Hotel reopened just over a year ago after a  major refit. It seems to have retained all the old colonial charm and I am sure acquired 21st century plumbing.  I am resolved to stay here on my next visit to Sri Lanka!	Date of stay: January 2017
Glyn12	A Grand Dame that needs a little polishing	"The Galle Face likes to think of itself as having been the best 19th century hotel East of Suez. It certainly retains its air of colonial elegance and is well worth a stay. But,if it accepted that good as it is, it does not measure up to The Oriental in Bangkok or Raffles in Singapore, then it might address that which stops it being really great. The staff, although very pleasant, on occasions can be amateurish and seem lost (especially at check-in), the rooms have charm but lack a little polish - our windows were filthy and the bathroom was not fully stocked in the way we had had at every other hotel in Sri Lanka. We had dinner in The 1864, the hotel's best restaurant. Unfortunately the restaurant is over the laundry and noise and vibration from the latter is a little"	Date of stay: January 2017
Flyingsaint1	Terrible Service	"We recently visited following recommendation from friends and a long-standing booking.  We had booked an advance package on the hotel website, which provided for a number of things such as a tour of the city, sea facing suites, meals etc.  When reconfirming the trip shortly prior to travelling, there was a wrinkle in terms of what was showing as booked, but we were assured on the telephone by the duty manager that all would be fine.  On arrival, the hotel did not honour the terms of the package and instead of placing us in our suite, the receptionist, Gerrard, put us in a double room and played as 'simple' and tied himself in knots as he dodged the issue or providing much of what was included in the package.  After a significant period of argument, it being evening and with our"	Date of stay: January 2017
TDT	Grand Old Dame	"We checked in for a night's stay and were immediately impressed by the grandeur of the property. We have stayed at several similar properties across Asia so arrived in full knowledge of the pros and cons that a grand old dame brings with her.  And the Galle Face has both - it has the relaxed colonial atmosphere, old school antique furnishings, polished marble lobby etc on the plus side, and the floor-board creakiness, mustiness and lack of sound-proofing on the other.  In terms of sound-proofing, this normally wouldn't have been an issue I suspect, but from before 5am there were loudspeakers hailing at full volume as part of the preparations for a military parade.  But again - not all bad - you don't often get to wake up to a military band with thousands of marchers (including a"	Date of stay: January 2017
Duncan E	"Nice, pleasant stay"	It's a lovely Colonial style hotel. We arrived very early hours of the morning and were well looked after.

Goldrichie	Timeless jewel	"Well it has probably all been said about this place. It is a true icon and still delivers in spades. Service is impeccable and location cannot be beaten. Wi fi works well everywhere and rooms are tastefully decorated, but the best thing is you know that you are staying in a place that has been a hotel for over 150 years. There is a lack of pretence about this place that is refreshing for a hotel of this stature. Yes it is a splurge hotel but not in a crazy, over the top way. More you will know that you have stayed in an iconic hotel at still manages to stay real - so, if you like big old hotels that have not lost sight of their heritage and offer a contemporary not over the top experience, then this is it. Bravo!"	Date of stay: January 2017
CLPRtravel	Loved our room and genteel oasis	We loved our 2 night stay here to recharge after our long haul flight .  It was a real oasis of calm away from the city life.  The evening bag pipes and lowering of the flag at sunset all added to the charm. The light room we were offered was very spacious and beautifully decorated with good views down the coast and over the garden.  The breakfasts were good.  We returned with the family when back in Colombo to enjoy the lovely evening buffet together. We have very fond memories of our stay here.  We booked a pay now non refundable min 2 night stay 9 months in advance.  We were very disappointed to find out the money had not been taken greatly increasing  our cost and preventing us spreading out the holiday cost over the year as planned.	Date of stay: December 2016

pewefan	Uniquely Atmospheric	"This is one of the most charming places I have ever had the pleasure of staying in.  The historic nature of the Galle Face is enough to lure in even the busiest business traveler.  The walls of the ""Travelers Lounge"" is filled with photos of those who visited over the Hotel's long and unique history.  The hushed book and comfy chair filled library is a welcome harbor and alternative work space (wifi works great there).  The museum, including Prince Phillips actual car, is fascinating, coupled with historic photos lining most hallways and alcoves.  Mostly, the staff is top notch--friendly and experts in the execution of their duties--from the most senior to the most junior.  While I was in Colombo for a very busy work week, I finished that week much more relaxed than I would have"	Date of stay: January 2017
Fitzu17	All time classic	"Probably the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in! The staff are a joy & the rooms are comfortable, with a genuine old world charm. The hotel has its own museum & an Historian who conducts tours. Breakfast was excellent, with plenty of Sri Lankan options. The bagpipes & army officer lowering of the flag at sunset (whist enjoying a sundowner) is surely a unique hotel experience.  we started & finished our Sri Lankan adventure at the Galle Face & were welcomed back like old friends on our return. Pay the $, stay here or regret it."	Date of stay: January 2017
julie r	Generally good but room for improvem	"Staff attentive. Fish restaurant very good. Ambience excellent. Spa disappointing, no jacuzzi and steam and sauna not on when we visited.  Final night resulted in a poor sleep because person above us arrived back to the room after midnight  l and proceeded to walk the floor for approx half an hour with his/her shoes on. It was difficult to resume sleep and same person had a early check out. I am sure the hotel management must be aware of noisy floors in such an old building. There are cultural differences but maybe a polite notice asking guests to remove shoes on entering the room would reduce the problem. Unfortunately despite all the other fine aspects of the hotel this would prevent me from rebooking unless I could assure of a good nights sleep."	Date of stay: January 2017
Scott T	Great views from this historic hotel	"We only had one night in Colombo and were so glad we stayed here. The hotel is full of charm and character. The ocean views were amazing. The staff were courteous and attentive. The location is very good, just a short walk to the old town. The only let down was the limited menu at the à la carte restaurant, however everyone has different tastes so I wouldn't really call this a fault."	Date of stay: December 2016

Sunaina Patel	Completely Unacceptable Service and Experience	"Hi,  We checked in a big group of 8 rooms and we were given a room on the 2nd floor.   There was a really noisy function going on on the 1st floor and the music was so loud that the bed was shaking and the floor was vibrating. I had a pounding headache and couldn't even close my eyes or sleep.   When I complained I was told by the Duty Manager, there was nothing he could do till midnight.They never informed us when we checked in that this would be the case, and we wouldn't be able to sleep till past midnight.  The Duty Manager was unable to help. His name is Mr. Indika and he was the rudest, most discourteous person. We were paying hotel guests and he really didn't care. He said he couldn't stop the function, despite the inconvenience to the guests.   We have stayed in Boutique,"	Date of stay: January 2017

Amazing food and drinks to suit anyones taste, magnificent seaside views in the beautiful Sri Lankan weather, top it all off with a bagpipe accompanied flag lowering ceremony. Settle into the evening by candlelight and acoustic guitar and singing. I could go everyday and love it everyday. What makes it so perfect is the brilliant staff - Asanga you're the best!

PGRBrussels	A 'must' stay in Colombo	"The Galle Face is a class hotel....from the high level of service/professionalism of the staff, the very polished and colonial style of the hotel, to its great location in the city and its high class dining. I only regret I had a one night stay. But even in the short time I spent there it was immediately clear that this was a unique type of hotel, the level of client service is amazing, the courtesy and helpfulness of the staff outstanding - something so sadly lacking in many other top end hotels. From the fine veranda dining room, to the pool/seaside bar, the excellent breakfast and the well equipped classic rooms. Put that together with a good seafront location with easy access to the railway station, taxis and tuk tuks. One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in - and"	Date of stay: January 2017

secretname_shh	"Pool, cocktails and a heritage building - loved it."	"Wonderful huge, deep pool by the sea (which is great as the beach is too rough to swim in). Rooms are very comfortable and it's lovely to be in such an old hotel, always corridors to explore, you end up finding other restaurants, a museum or a library, or the spa.  Also the hotel is generous with the complimentary drinks in the mini-bar: water, iced tea and coconut water - all very welcome in the heat when you've been outside.  Recommend cocktails on the veranda in the evening, we did our best to work our way through the list, but it was too long for even a seasoned pair of soaks.....  Also loved the street food on the beach at night, especially the Mixed Seafood Kottu, which cost almost nothing and was EXCELLENT."	Date of stay: November 2016

Jacob S	Waterfront Bar	A friend and I (backpackers) were staying at a hostel elsewhere in the city and ventured into the Galle Face Hotel for a possible drink or two at their bar. We ended up staying 5 hours sitting and chatting at a gorgeous waterfront patio overlooking the Indian Ocean and watching the sunset. Our waiter Asanga was fantastic! We drank through dinner and he kept bringing us olives and finger food to snack on while we looked out over the water. We did not stay at the hotel but we loved our time there and would definitely have stayed there in hindsight.	Date of stay: January 2017
WHISKASyKANGOU	Ok but past its prime	Staff very friendly . The room is ok but the furnishings a little dated and the room is not the sort of place you feel like hanging around .

But much of the hotel is along the Galle Road so is quite noisy  Staffing: confusion over our booking but then they upgraded us which was great.  Very helpful.  Food: amazing breakfast buffet.  Expensive food and cocktails outside of that - and that is in comparison to other, comparable hotels nearby.  Room: we lucked out with the junior suite.  Super place, massive, wooden floors, great bathroom facilities, and top quality bedding.  View on two sides.  Noisy because we overlooked Galle Road and the roundabout, so we really struggled to sleep.

We stayed 3 nights at the end of our 3+ weeks tour of Sri Lanka.  It was certainly the pick of the hotels we stayed at. I enjoyed the fact that we could open the window in our room and use a ceiling fan instead of air-con.   The buffet breakfast was very good.  As we were at the end of our tour round the country, we had eaten more than enough buffet meals so were looking for non-buffet options for lunch and dinner.  We found the restaurant options at the nearby Cinnamon Grand to be more attractive.   Whilst we found the service to generally be of a high standard, there were a couple of clunky moments on arrival and departure.  We had booked two rooms, but"	Date of stay: January 2017

Drinks were watered by the pool bar, the breakfast buffet is the only option @ Rs 2250 + 30% tax + 10% service & pretty basic/tasteless.  The dinner buffet Rs 3500 ++ was similarly mundane  & lacked any flavour.  None of the food showed off the fantastic flavours of the cuisine.

Farah_Pervez	Average hotel living of its past success...	"Although the setting of this hotel could be considered picturesque the hotel itself is living off its history and is more style than substance. I've never seen so much pomp and ceremony taking over an establishment relative to the effort they put in with their guests.  We have stayed in much better hotels, in more sought after destinations than Colombo, and the owners and management need to travel to see what the modern traveller seeks in the 21st century in a very competitive market, especially at this price point. The complimentary mini-bar is just a few small cartons of poor quality juice so was very disappointing. Again, this is not the standard for hotels they wish to compete with.  Due to the age of the building the noise insulation is poor, at best. We could constantly"	Date of stay: January 2017

I loved every inch of the bustling yet historical atmosphere, and the pool by the sea was a neat touch.    Unfortunately, my room with a balcony overlooking the ocean had a strong mildew smell.  While otherwise comfortable enough, with powerful a/c and a good shower, I was disappointed that they would offer me such a bad smelling room (they were unable to change it until the next night due to the holiday period).  I think choice of room is extremely important here,"	Date of stay: December 2016
CrisEdinburgh	Most romantic hotel in Asia	"One of the oldest hotels east of Aden (if not the oldest), this beautifully restored British colonial hotel is also one of the most romantic. Right on the Galle Face sea front, in the middle of Colombo city, it could not be placed more conveniently. At the same time, it brilliantly preserves its old world charm and gentility of service. The rooms are full of elegant wood work and there are polished dark wooden floors throughout, with a magnificent original wooden staircase in the centre of the lobby. A high point is the large verandah restaurant over-looking the sea. This is NOT air-conditioned but cooled by large ceiling fans, just as in colonial days. It is fabulously fantastic.

There are countless things which can be improved about the hotel (which seems to be typical of any Sri Lankan hotel) but the building, swimming pool and setting right by the sea cancel out all of those problems.

We expressed these concerns and returned after a fantastic tour of the central and southern parts of the country.  Our follow-on stay was much more enjoyable.  We were offered a choice of rooms and chose the 3rd floor, as all 4th floor rooms are SMOKING.  Ours included a soaking tub, which was much appreciated.  The seaside pool was well-attended.

They also only charged us 1/2 price for our 12 year old children who clearly ate their weight in food. The high tea was a bit disappointing. We had to come the day before to place a deposit since we had 8 people, even though there was clearly space available the day of, and then a lengthy process for them to correct the bill to reflect the previously paid balance.

Major check in issues both times (lost reservations, reserved room not available, etc.) but after time and effort made more than whole by managers.

mary5711	Disappointing Afternoon Tea	"The food was good. There was no choice of teas and it was served out of a thermos! The service was appalling and we had to ask many times for fresh tea.  Fantastic setting as the sun set and lowering of the national flag with a piper.  It was expensive and disappointing - with proper staff training and a selection of teas, it could be a rewarding experience."	Date of stay: December 2016

Rexid40	HYGIENE ALERT: faeces littered shower and terrible apathetic staff	"I travel a considerable amount for work and pleasure, and have high expectations of 5 star hotels that have become institutions through their longevity and hard work. Sadly this hotel has fundamental issues with how they treat their customers and hygiene.  During my 24 hr stay I had two incidents: 1. A staff member asked me to pay/sign someone else's bill to my room because he had made a mistake and the staff member couldn't find the person who had incurred the bill, and 2. By far the worse issue was that during a spa treatment I was shown to a shower by a staff member only to find that the shower floor was littered with faeces! Considering the room was locked before I entered this just indicates that the staff don't clean the hotel and spa properly and management don't check."	Date of stay: January 2017
Roy V	Pamper yourself with the very best in Colombo	"Much has been written about this iconic hotel. It is a matter of whether one is prepared to pay the premium to enjoy the very best in the city. Maybe 2 days is enough to get a sense of the history associated with the hotel. Location can't be beat. Staff is well-trained. The room we stayed in was remarkable, especially with a peek of the water. Pick a non-peak period to enjoy the luxury if budget is a constraint. The travel office was very helpful but the driver they assigned to us was new to the area (he came from Kandy). As a result, I had to take charge of the day trip to the Bawa estate at Lunuganga. This was the only disappointment of our stay but it did not affect our overall impression of the property."	Date of stay: December 2016

Gustavali	Terrible Afternoon Tea	Totally ignored by the staff and an Afternoon Tea worse than what you would get at a McDonalds. Two small pieces of dry spongecake was all we recieved.

John F	The Galle Face-Lift?	"We stayed at the grande dame of Colombo hotels 5 years ago and were absolutely blown away by it's turn-of-the-century splendor.  The stunning old appointments, the first-of-its-kind elevator, the historical trappings, and the impeccable service brought a by-gone era to life.  Breakfast on the expansive terrace, looking out at Indian Ocean wave tops made the exotic offerings - a panoply of the best fruit you've ever had, served by attendant waiters - the very best a Westerner could hope for in his first night in Sri Lanka.  The rooms themselves resonated with 1900s charm and brought to life the visit of the Queen in the 1950s.  It really was something.  Sadly, in an effort to keep pace with shiny new modern hotels in and around Colombo, the Galle Face seems to have missed a step."	Date of stay: December 2016
agoodbrew	If you can't afford to stay ... make sure you go there	This iconic Colombo hotel has been magnificently refurbished and presents as it would have done to the Colonial society that frequented it prior to independence. We didn't stay here as we are curious but budget tourists but Gin and Tonic or a cup of tea in the Balcony is a must for any visitor to Colombo. Also if the hotel is offering its buffet dinner don't miss it. The food is amazingly good and we paid in the vicinity of $25 Aus for the most delicious night out.	Date of stay: July 2016
pai_na_cozinha	Colonial Masterpiece......Apathetic Service!	"If bricks and mortar alone counted, then this hotel is amongst the Grand-daddy of the hospitality business. The property has and continues to be maintained and it appears that the management and owners are managing to just about keep up with the cruel affects of time on this treasure of a building. Both the refurbished rooms and the ones that are ready to be refurbished are charming enough to excuse the slightly rough edges. Pay for a junior suite and enjoy the true wonder of this hotel with sea views and drinks served in the Long Bar each evening (where the staff were excellent too!)  Having lived, worked and travelled extensively in South Asia, we are familiar with the slow pace and somewhat hit and miss service one can expect - that said the service here hits an all time low."

BrandaneBangkok	Great location but..	"The setting and history of the hotel are grand and I have seen it compared to Raffles and the Peninsula Hong Kong. The staff were unfailingly friendly and tried to be helpful. Good Christmas buffet, and it wasn't the hotel's fault that this was a 'dry' day in Sri Lanka - my first time I can remember having only water with Christmas lunch..  However, some significant downsides - it is very noisy (both in terms of the traffic being next to a very busy road/traffic junction) and with the room style, no effective double glazing. Worse still, there are a large number of functions hosted here and if you are unfortunate enough to be located above one of these (we were, in the Landmark rooms, which don't command a sea view) you may find the MC calls and loud thumping music a problem if"	Date of stay: December 2016

95natea	Second time lucky in love	"This was our second trip to Sri Lanka, this time for transit only. We knew we HAD to stay at the Galle Face and we were glad we did. More than a year had passed since we last stayed at this historic treasure and the renovations were complete! Even more glorious than our first visit. We fell more deeply in love with this hotel, as it's even more luxurious in modern time with a touch of ""old-world"" class. Our visit coincided just before Christmas and the hotel was decked out in beautiful holiday costume. The all white 15 foot Christmas tree in the new lobby sparkled.  Our room was on the old 4th floor with huge suite proportion, windows all around. But like anything in Sri Lanka, night time is completely different than day time; so was the noise from the street. The room itself,"	Date of stay: December 2016

We especially enjoyed  our pre-breakfast swims in the pool which seems to be twice as long as the last time (2009). The food was lovely, though I missed some of the variety of tropical fruit juices I remembered from my first visit. The library was excellent, as were all the staff. Thank you for a brief but great stay."	Date of stay: December 2016

khellon	A Grand hotel that is a pleasure to stay in despite its faults	"Recently renovated without destroying its character, this hotel is a pleasure for anyone who wishes to revel in the old colonial days with modern amenities. There are faults but really one has to soak up the atmosphere and relive bygone days to enjoy this place. The hotel is not about the accommodation which is adequate but about the history and the atmosphere which the current management to their credit have tried to preserve. Happy hour drinks on the terrace are an affordable must and the Scottish piper ceremony in lowering the flag at dusk is a memorable tradition harking back to the old colonial days. Breakfast is also a memorable experience being provided on the terrace complete with sparkling wine."	Date of stay: December 2016

TheOExpress	Perfectly grand setting.	"During our visit to Colombo we did not stay here but were lucky enough to have a drink in the Traveller's Bar and eat at the Verandah. The setting is quite stunning, with colonial architecture par excellence: a manicured, grand walkways and whitewashed columns. Our food from the buffet was absolutely delicious, and cost only 25GBP-ish too! In particular, the tandoori chicken and beetroot curries were unbelievably tasty. Service was also spot-on and the drinks selection was good, though we couldn't really see far past the lovely local beer, Lion. Very, very impressed!"	Date of stay: December 2016

I have been to Galle Face before but it always appeared a bit tired and dated. But after a recommendation we decided to host our quarterly board meeting here.   I arrived at 2am and noticed noise from the adjacent beach lot where the was a carnival with loud music and request to room far away - room 3076 was an excellent junior suite room, classic looking, well appointed and updated. I could still hear the noise but fell asleep after a long trip.

Sensational High Tea with good view to the ocean. Long Swimming Pool with nice bar. Room with wooden floor, fan and high ceiling, marble in the bathroom. High security level because Hotel is used by officials. At our stay there was an international conference. But we never had any problems because of that. Best place to visit Colombo Fort or City on foot."	
Cfincham	Fantastic colonial charm and impeccable service	"We have stayed in Sri Lanka several times and decided to stay in Colombo on this occasion, we selected the Galle Face and am so glad we did. Despite there being an international naval conference at the hotel for the first few days the hotel was relaxed and the service was impeccable. The staff could not have been more attentive, but never felt overbearing. The room, a suite, was very bright, with a great sea view. The pool, salt water, was very relaxing. The history and charm of this hotel cannot be understated with the amazing array of historical photos and guests from bygone days simply make it a superb place to stay."	Date of stay: November 2016

Positives of my stay in this the hotel:  1. The sea side view - We didn't have the sea facing room, but still I enjoyed our evening walk in the garden area. 2.

It is however quite stately. Everthing is calm and cool and relaxed. As you lay on the sunbed or have a drink and meal by the pool bar, the setting becomes very addictive. They do a good martini, half decent coffee, and the food is very good. Lots of weddings of various religions which are interesting to observe. It is very close to the Cinnamon Grand which is a bit of a zoo but great fun to have a drink in and people watch when you want something lively to do or an alternative for dinner out..The Shangri La and Grand Hyatt are being built close by.

I visited the place with two other friends and ordered some drinks a coffee, a piece of butter cake and and piece of cheese cake.  Lets forget the size of the cheese cake, for what we had doubts whether they have served some creme topped by crumbles. Very poor quality. And the funniest thing is that we ended up paying Rs 550 for a OLD, DRY, piece of butter cake (No garnish, no doily, No icing sugar topping, NOTHING, Just a piece of cake in a plate) the same price we paid for that tiny little cheese cake(This is without Govt Taxes, or service chargers).

Built in 1864 it has history, oodles of famous guests from Mark Twain to Harrison Ford, fine dining and a breakfast buffet that goes on forever. It has multiple bars and restaurants and the best service you can get anywhere in the world. Right on the Indian ocean with beautiful sunsets and a bagpiper at sunset when they bring down the flag.   Emmanuel the concierge is a gem. He arranged for a private car to take us around the city for shopping and sightseeing.

It is a lovely grand historical hotel with a great feel of old colonial Sri Lanka. If you are not looking for perfect service or comforts, than you will love it. We are used to how things are in SL (that things can and will go wrong!), so we enjoyed our stay on the whole.   Upon arrival, we had booked a car from the airport which never showed. Luckily there was a Galle Face desk at the airport and they were able to arrange one fairly quickly. We wanted a room with a terrace so were given one overlooking the sea, in the old wing. It could have done with some modernising, but it was very spacious and the views right on the ocean made up for the rest."	Date of stay: November 2016

Fair enough we thought and just ordered tea. The waiter came back and told us it was possible to have 'butter cake', we were pleased at the accommodation and happily agreed. Two stale slices of cake materialised, with not quite hot tea - still ... still, the view was stunning, the terrace a colonial delight, truly superb.

TravelScoutNZ	Home away from home	Galle Face is one of my most favourite places to stay whenever I am away from home. It's like stepping back in time to a place where life was much more elegant and people had time to enjoy the finer things.	Date of stay: October 2016

lookingaroundfornow	One night stay just eifht	Colombo is a great city in Sri Lanka. Stayed there for one night. Great old building that has been well maintained. Definitely from British era. Staff super helpful and always smiling. They understand English very well but are not necessarily able to translate it well back to you in English but their eagerness to help makes all the difference. Right on the water with great food. A great place to chill as you head to other parts of Sri Lanka and the world.	Date of stay: October 2016
nfaruqi2016	A colonial gem	"We were to stay at another hotel but got to know that the Galle Face had undergone renovations recently so decided to stay here. It is indeed a beautiful property that has been very tastefully renovated oozing of old world charm with beautiful colonial era furniture. Unfortunately I was in Colombo for one night only but loved every moment of the hotel stay. The buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner were all superb and the cool Arabian breeze and lofty coconut palm trees simply did wonders to the dining experience."	Date of stay: October 2016
Gerard R	Wonderful location & historic building	"We stayed here for four nights. The staff are very helpful & the restaurants serve good quality food at reasonable prices. The quality of food is consistent, which for an organisation that caters for over two thousand meals a day including the many functions held at the hotel daily.  The hotel has recently appointed an American General Manager & I hope he upgrades the facilities in the rooms & specially in the suites to a luxury level. The floor boards were creaky, more attention to detail in the general up keep of the hotel is needed to deserve a better rating by international standards. If the hotel can upgrade some of the common areas & rooms, it can easily command higher rates & better star rating. This is inevitable if the Hotel is to face competition in the next two years"	Date of stay: October 2016

klav	Colonial hotel at its best	We stayed there 3 nights to finalize our Sri Lankan tour. The room was spacious and clean. The breakfast buffet was brilliant. There was a nice swimming pool filled with ocean water with a bar near by where you can order a drink or a snack without changing your swimming dress. Highly recommended to taste a colonial hotel charm at its best	Date of stay: October 2016
Helen G	Fabulous hotel	"This is our 4th time to the Galle Face Hotel. The restaurants are wonderful, the views are brilliant and the bedrooms are a high standard. Lovely service, very polite and thoughtful. On bank holidays or special celebrations you can not buy alcohol so good to take some little miniatures in your bag just in case."	Date of stay: October 2016
Dada B	Charming colonial hotel on the beach in the middle of the city	"What I liked best about this hotel are: it doesn't smell old :) and the sound of the crashing waves at night that accompanies your sleep! After this, are the service which is impeccable; and the old grandeur. I think many hotels tried to re-create the colonial feel, but this hotel is sincerely and truly old, the real deal. Breakfast comes with champagne. The different lobbies are full of fresh flowers. When you check in, they give you toffee. Your room awaits you with a plate of sweets. In your fridge are complimentary sri lankan local snacks and drinks, including coconut water. When you hang out by the poolside, they give you complimentary fresh fruits. And the architecture is truly beautiful. The room is ample sized, with modern amenities. We are happy we checked in here"	Date of stay: October 2016
petereastwood	Awesome colonial hotel. The location is perfect. The staff very attentive and pleasant. The breakfast buffet delicious b	The staff are so good at this hotel. The food ( especially the breakfast buffet ) is wonderful. Shame they no longer offer their world famous potato curry for breakfast. I was really looking forward to it. ( I've stayed twice before and this is what got me to breakfast early every morning!)	Date of stay: October 2016

loumac22	Awesome place	"I love the fact that Rathna, the beautiful doorman who reminds me of my father is still there. I look forward to seeing him next time we visit.  Excellent buffet, large expansive bedroom, comfortable bed, very friendly staff. slightly expensive but well worth it"	
zoe r	Beautiful luxery hotel with fantastic service	"This is the hotel to stay at in Colombo. Since the extensive renovations, this hotel now has not only excellent service but luxury rooms and facilities to go with it.  Sunset drinks by the pool are excellent (amazing reasonably priced cocktails!) and then we had supper at the Seaspray restaurant- fantastic service, great table right next to the sea (literally had a little bit of sea spray!) and delicious food (including oysters-yum!). The staff were all great. As an added bons you really feel you are staying in a place with history- the museum has information on the extensive history of the hotel and all the celebrities who have stayed there. This is what a professional hotel should aspire to."	Date of stay: September 2016
Cafe G	Great place to have dinner by the sea	It's a huge hotel situated in the beach and you can enjoy a romantic dinner by the sea with the wind blowing through your hair carrying the smell of salt. Quite an authentic experience. It's a bit crowded due to the high demand	Date of stay: October 2015
Jenna E	2 night stay after a long journey	We flew from England to Sri Lanka which took us around 24 hours as we had a long stopover so we wanted somewhere to relax for 2 days before continuing with our holiday. This hotel is quite classic and very grand. The staff are very helpful and they have a great concierge service in reception. They also have a fleet of Nissan compact SUV's. The pool area at this hotel is wonderful. You sit overlooking the sea on your subbed and there is a great bar service to your subbed. The cocktails are fantastic! There is also a pool man with fresh towels. The pool is large. The food is good at this hotel and there are quite a few different restaurants. We particularly liked the a la Carte restaurant 1864 which ended up being cheaper than the standard buffet restaurant! We were quite	Date of stay: September 2016

Robyrc	Solid four stars	"I stayed in Galle Face hotel for a week at the beginning of September, to attend a conference meeting. Galle is one of the oldest hotels in South-East Asia built over 150 years ago and it has old world colonial flavor, with large bedrooms and a beautiful reception. The hotel is large, composed of few wings, and provides all necessary, modern amenities. It has three restaurants, two bars, one of which is a pool bar that offers beautiful views of Indian Ocean, and a small museum/gallery displaying hotel’s memorabilia of its glorious past. Service is excellent and food, both at breakfast and dinner, very good. Overall a good experience."	Date of stay: September 2016
Lucymoody43	Colonial Elegance in Colombo	"We only stayed in the Galle Face Hotel for one night but we had a lovely stay there. The hotel itself exudes old world colonial style, with large bedrooms and a beautiful reception hall. We didnt try the pool but we had a relaxing drink in the outside bar - very tastefully decorated and could watch the world go by. I would definately recommend Galle Face Hotel as a relaxing haven to get away from the hussle and bussle of the city."	Date of stay: August 2016
Las Buganvillas	Great colonial architecture	"I only went  to the hotel for drinks because I admire great monuments of colonial architecture in Asia:: that Galle Face delivers. However, if you expect the style of Mount Lavinia, or further Raffles in Singapore or Oriental in Bangkok, you will be dispapointed-"	Date of stay: September 2016
Priya D	Having a few drinks near the Pool Area	"I went in the evening for a drink with my wife and it was really fantastic with the sound of the waves, the sunset etc. The person who served us our drinks made our time there extremely enjoyable by cracking jokes, talking to us etc. He made us feel really at home. His name was Asanka. So thank you Asanka for being so helpful and cheerful. I wanted to know where we could buy some Aperol and he promptly sent me an SMS the next day with the telephone number of the F & B contact whom I could ask. We will be definitely going there more often."	Date of stay: September 2016
poppy425	amazing end to our trip	"lovely colonial hotel, our room had seaview, very clean, bathroom was luxurious and loved the spacious walk in shower! the mini bar only had non-alcoholic drinks but they are complimentary. we were given a late check out which was great appreciated as our flight was not until late that evening. the breakfast and also the buffet dinner in the restaurant had an amazing selection of food. the service around the whole hotel was impeccable. watch the sunset from the pool bar. they also have a guy playing the bagpipe while they lower the Sri Lankan Flag. Cocktails at the bar were very nice and the waiters were attentive. there's also a museum about the history of the hotel including all the famous people that have ever stayed and also Prince Philip's first car! this 5 star hotel is"	Date of stay: September 2016

char_dut	Buffet dinner at The Verandah	"A big selection at the buffet including Ceylonese, Asian, Western. We selected Ceylonese curries and breads only. Also mainly tried Sri Lankan desserts. Everything was very good. A bit pricey, but was great being able to try the different sorts of curries and also experience the world famous Galle Face Hotel atmosphere. Staff were very friendly and made us feel welcome, even though we weren't staying at the hotel. Beautiful view over ocean and can smell the sea from the table. Would recommend requesting table by end of Verandah to get breeze from ocean and see the view."	Date of stay: September 2016
brides13	Lovely end to our holiday	We ended our Sri Lankan trip at the iconic Galle Face hotel and unfortunately only stayed for one night. We arrived into Colombo on New Year's Eve and the city was very quiet so we were happy to just laze about the hotel. It was a beautiful colonial hotel and we could see why it was so popular. The rooms were old but maintained well and had everything you could need/want. As the sun went down over the Indian Ocean we sat and enjoyed some mocktails by the pool (NYE - there was no alcohol) which was just so wonderful. We enjoyed buffet dinner in the restaurant - from memory the food was fine but the restaurant was a nice space to enjoy a long dinner. We left very early the next morning so when we are next back in Colombo we will be sure to drop in again. Comes highly recommended.	Date of stay: April 2016
Inspire586724	Perfect end before flight!	"Fabulous last night in Sri Lanka, wonderful old colonial hotel.   The staff cannot do enough for you, beautiful location and views to die for.  Cocktails and fish for supper are highly recommended!   Luxury honeymoon location."	Date of stay: September 2016
Lisa M	Lovely hotel	We really enjoyed our time at the Galle Face hotel. A beautiful old building with recently upgraded facilities. Beautifully situated next to the sea it was lovely to lie by the pool and dine near. The food was exceptional. I throughly recommend this little piece of history.	Date of stay: September 2016
Louis M	"Overpriced basic rooms, shoddy maintenance, but fantastic location and ambiance and excellent breakfast."	"Booked on booking.com and got a nasty surprise when there was a nearly 30% uplift in price with various additional taxes and service charges.  Not a great start.  Room basic but fine, although had a locked door to another room and I could hear everything going on next door.  Hotel was not nearly full, so I don't understand why they didn't just fill other rooms.  Not really great peace and quiet or what one would expect for the high price.  Nor a demonstration of an understanding of what a guest wants when staying in such a place.  Air conditioning poor - maybe brought the temperature down to 24 degrees at its strongest, but not what one expects from a supposedly top hotel.    They don't seem too bothered with maintenance and seem happy to rest on their laurels.  My shower drain"	Date of stay: September 2016
Michael R	"Ice cream, lunch and high tea"	"I have visited this hotel several times. Recently it has been renovated. There is an air of colonial about this darling of a place. The staff are very courteous even if one is merely passing through. The ice cream on one occasion, the bouffe lunch on another and a fine high tea on yet another were reasonably prices, beautifully presented by the fine staff. Watched two elderly staff with catapults scaring off crows... nothing fired but the crows took no chances. Hope to stay there some time. The hotel contains a small museum room housing the first car ever owned by the Duke of Edinburg when he was on the staff of Mountbatten during the war. Terrace has fine view of the ocean."

THILINA M	Most memorable day of my life	We took our wedding ceremony in galle face hotel with around 300 guests.  They did fabulous job to make that day even more memorable. On the same day it was my brother in laws bday too.  Hotel staff helped us tremendously make him surprise with his cake.  Food was delicious. There was no single complain from a guest about food.  I'd like to thank all the ppl who make our day even more memorable. Thank you.	Date of stay: December 2015
Manel K	Faded glory of the colonial era	"After a long flight into Colombo, a busy bus and crazy tuk tuk ride, we were warmly greeted by the reception staff, and served with a welcome chilled cranberry juice. The room was a good size, and had a free soft drinks mini bar and tea and coffee facilities. It was comfortable, but it was quite utilitarian and lacking in glamour, with the feel of a colonial governmental office. However, the staff were helpful and friendly, the buffet breakfast was excellent and the grounds attractive with a really nice pool, restaurant and bar area. The location on the coast meant there was a permanent cooling breeze. Overall, this hotel was a pleasant experience, worth nearly 5 stars but it just needs a gentle hand to re-energise the faded colonial glory."	Date of stay: September 2016
IEatLOVEPray	Indeed the Grand Old Dame	"What a transformation from 15 years ago! Beautifully restored to its original splendour,  it is definitely a jewel of a hotel.   Our room was well appointed with care taken to fit out the rooms, blending in old world charm to present day conveniences. The room was well lit and I particularly liked having a private seating area. Pity we didn't have the view on the sea !   The bed was comfy - good pillows, bed linen and a fab pillow menu and The room service menu was ample with quite a variety to select from. The mini bar came with complimentary snacks and juices - the bottled coconut water was delish!  The bathroom although a tad small was well appointed but the toiletries could definitely be improved. A tie up with the likes of Spa Ceylon or better would be more appropriate for"	Date of stay: September 2016
Rajesh Lakhanpal	Fantastic Hotel	"Stayed at this hotel for almost a week during a business conference. The service, food and the location of the hotel is just fantastic. The food is based around European themes. The hotel could do with an Asian restaurant. The beach next to the hotel is ideal for a morning jog or a leisurely walk during the evening when it is full with families and locals enjoying the evening."	Date of stay: April 2016
Adrian S	Well Kept Colonial Hotel	Well kept but pricey hotel. Good location to be based out of. Lovely to sit on the deck of an evening and watch the sun set. Only issues were slow service at the bar and our room was a little noisy on account of its closeness to the main road nearby.	Date of stay: April 2016
SP_JP	A magnificent colonial	"We stayed at the Galle Face Hotel for 2 nights during a recent guided tour of Sri Lanka. The staff could not do enough to help us with any issues. The food was perfect, we had 2 breakfasts and a dinner and none of them could be faulted. The view is great and the building has so much character that you could imagine visiting back in the colonial days."	Date of stay: April 2016
Anton Edema	Verandah	"FCPMA hosted the guests from Russia and Thailand for dinner. The service was exceptional. The Old dutch English mix architecture was maintaining the expected Sri Lankan hospitality. Though it was humid and near to the the sea, environment was pleasant and soothing to all of us. Wide variety of food with Indonesian touch. Meats and sea food was well balanced with vegetarian was beyond explanation. Vehicle parking was little difficult due to excess visitors. Excellent staff always on the ball to serve the hosts. Visitors were impressed."	Date of stay: April 2016

Space cadet	Grand old colonial style	"What a wonderful introduction to Sri Lanka! We spent our first two nights here on our first trip to this wonderful country and you couldn't have a better experience. With a slight jaded charm despite being spotlessly maintained inside and out. Our  room was huge with a wonderful marble bathroom, huge shower and complimentary mini bar. Located right on the iconic Galle Face Green a moments walk from the old fort district with wonderful restaurants and colonial architecture."	Date of stay: April 2016

Gerard K	Lovely hotel worth visiting but not staying. We will not stay again.	"Firstly the good points. It is hard to fault the location and the veranda/garden area opening out to the ocean is stunning. The breakfast is excellent but you would expect it to be at the price and in such a large business hotel. The pool-side food was very poor for the price. The building itself has been very well restored (still some work).  Do not pay the $50 dollars to pick up from the airport you can get a very good quality taxi with air conditioning from the airport for a third of the price without haggling. Ordering taxis at the hotel does seem to involve some sort of hotel premium.  The service is poor but not for lack of staff, but for lack of the right focus. I was hassled to fill out a survey form by more staff than seemed available to order a cup of coffee.  I"	Date of stay: March 2016
GopikaAJ	Gorgeous Vintage Hotel with the advantage of the Best Location in Colombo	"My December family holiday started on a perfect note when we checked in our pre-booked hotel room at the Galle Face Hotel, Colombo. Stunning location, gorgeous vintage property. From the outside the hotel might not look very updated because its a historic property but once you step in, you are transported to the era of elegance and galore. A red carpet (literally red carpeted hotel) treatment was laid out beautifully. A gorgeous white Christmas tree with angels adorning it. The most courteous staf welcomed us with fresh fruit juice and wet towels. The check-in was smooth ! We had the most gorgeous room with glass walls on 2 sides both overlooking the pool and the sea ! We had the waves crashing the hotel's outskirts at all times and it felt as if we were always on the beach.   A"	Date of stay: December 2015

DebbieTeale	Breathtaking	Wonderful experience from arrival to departure. From the moment you are met at reception you will feel like you are back in a time of graciousness. The service is extraordinary throughout the hotel. The air conditioned Travellers Bar was a wonderful respite from the heat.   If you're there on a Friday night you should promenade the Galle Face with the locals and enjoy the atmosphere and sunset.	Date of stay: March 2016
Dan G	"Spotless, relaxing and fantastic location!"	"We arrived here as our first stop on a 3 week self-assembled Sri Lanka tour and it was a perfect way to be introduced to the country!   After going through the airport and into the arrivals hall, you are greeted by hundreds of people and a wall of humidity which can be quite overwhelming, so arriving at this grand hotel on the seafront of Colombo is just what we needed to ease ourselves back into the Sri Lankan culture at the speed that we wanted to.  We were greeted very warmly with a welcome drink in the foyer and then escorted to our room. The room was spacious and clean, and came with electronic safe and television. My only negative comment would be that the bath plug was broken, and when we asked for it to be fixed their solution was to remove the plug entirely, so we could"	Date of stay: March 2016
Mar186525	Old world charm in modernised setting	"A charming welcome and efficient check in.  Our refurbished room had a spacious en suite, was clean and well appointed.  Buffet breakfast is extensive.  Staff are attentive without being obsequious.  We were shown around the museum which is really interesting.  The outdoor seating provides a great spot to watch the sun go down. The Pub (part of the hotel but a separate entrance) is a good place for a beer and has live music/quiz night.  The band playing the night we were there was excellent."	Date of stay: January 2016
MarkFin013	Convenient hotel for short stay	"Good enough for short stay. I stayed 2 nights and was completely fine. My room was medium size but ergonomically setup so it was quite comfortable.
