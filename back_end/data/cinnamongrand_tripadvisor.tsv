"Jack Hanson","The Courtyard - Attention with a Smile!","Recently, I spent a few days in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on my way to Singapore. Our agent set up our first meeting, for breakfast at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel (Courtyard)! What a treat, it turned out to be!  Subsequently… we had all 4 meetings at the Courtyard.  Yes… any hotel can provide delicious food, laid out in an appealing arrangement.  But, motivating the staff to go beyond is not an easy task. It takes a special effort, and a commitment.  Everyone was so attentive ensuring each customer’s need; it is difficult to single out one person. Even the folk in the kitchen were always with a smile, and a nod of acknowledgment.  But I would certainly be remiss if I did not mention a couple of the managers who were present: 1.	Like a General, Udaya was keeping an eye on everything; he","Date of stay: February 2020"

I live in a foreign country and thought of publishing a review about the function as the staff was able to 'WOW ' us with their extraordinary service.  Firstly organizing such an  event is cumbersome through telephone and email. But from the very beginning of communicating with the relevant staff of the hotel we felt very comfortable and everything was done according to plan. I would say the staff went ' above and beyond ' to attend even the minor details of the function. The food was simply the best and our guests from Sri Lanka and the overseas thoroughly enjoyed the sumptuous buffet. Thank you Cinnamon Grand Hotel for a job well done.

The hotel is in a great location and offers lots of amenities. Hotel is also kept very clean. One thing that bothered me however is we had a late dinner and sat in the lobby after midnight one day. When I asked for water, we were told to go to our room. This was not nice and I thought that was rude, as if we were kids staying past our bedtime.

"Erandie S","Evening out with friends","This is by far one of the best places for seafood without a doubt. Being our first time we tried The Lagoon we were not sure what to order. Channa was very helpful in making sure we made the right choices and combinations. The modha with Thai curry was a wonderful mixture of taste. The Chillie garlic prawns were up point and these made a good combination with the steamed rice. The tamarind cuttle fish was a bit too sour for our taste but managed to blend in. I have always felt that Cinnamon grand is high in the list when it comes to hospitality. And they never fail to keep these standards high. Damith and Sachith made sure that they upheld these standards. I will highly recommend this place for family and friends to have a slow dinner and a long talk.","Date of stay: March 2020"

"Trek772371","Coffee Stop","The coffee stop is my refuge, this place I can make believe that I am in a caring society. At the tables are my imaginary friends in a transient community. We are born to need social bonds. We are born to need a sense of others, even if we are alone. It is terrible for the higher brain to know that we are solitary, that our life path has asked us to learn how to be the warrior instead of the cosseted, the protector and not the protected. Yet there is a need to fool the senses that this society is a safe place and we belong to a tribe. So in this cafe, among the noises of people, their scent, their occasional glances and the chatter of the baristas, I give my primitive brain a little of what it craves, just enough to see me though","Date of stay: July 2019"

We had lunch in the bar which was nice, but breakfast was a stressful experience - it was almost impossible to get a cup of coffee and there were so many people at the buffet. I'd suggest the hotel make tea and coffee self service because there only seemed to be one person serving it on a tray from very small jugs which constantly needed to be refilled. Other than that, our room was nice but the staff were far too attentive - we had three visits in the space of about an hour from housekeeping, including one to check the contents of the minibar literally 5 minutes after we'd arrived. We then also got asked if they could clean our room on the day we were","Date of stay: January 2020"

However the two young waiters were very polite and attentive and made up for the grumpy middle aged Sr waiter.  The food was average at best. I was really looking forward to lobster....

Its a very commercial minded hotel whereas they have lost touch of human values.

I have been visiting this coffee shop for years, decades even, and I can always count on either my order getting delayed, or being made to wait at the counter even though I am next in line to be served, or the order being taken down wrong. The servers insists that the food/beverages you order are brought to you even though you are happy to take it yourself, which inevitably results in your order taking an inexplicably long time to reach you or being served something you never ordered or having your order brought in with one or more items less. There is never an apology tendered for any of these mishaps. Those behind the counter have an air of superiority. For a 5 star hotel, of the cinnamon chain no less, you'd expect far better","Date of stay: December 2019"

I had mentioned that I had recently stayed at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel and how fantastic it was. His response was, he felt that it was dated and the aesthetic level was not as high as other hotels he had stayed at. So for him it was the aesthetics  and the modernisation of the building.

They have a very good range of drinks as well as wide range of seafood for you to pick and get prepared. The difficult task for us was to figure out the quantities of each item. Channa at the restaurant was our guide in this. He was extremely helpful in helping us to select sufficient amounts of items and also suggested best preparations of each items. Dishes arrived on time and was simply awesome. I recommend Lagoon for anyone and if you get stuck choosing items, Channa is the man to look out for.","Date of stay: October 2019"

When i try to book the cheers pub yesterday for the reservation they informed us bar is open for walkings and other reservations all ready done. Eventhough when we visted the premises today around 1pm the bar is reserved by keeping bottels and there are few people just sitting around without spending but only speaking.

"natashakabra","Not as good as it used to be","This is my third time at Cinnamon Grand and I wasn't too happy with the overall experience.   Firstly, the check-in process was really long compared to the other properties we stayed at in Sri Lanka. Secondly, the breakfast was served in a really small stuffy hall and the food was just about average, which I'm hoping is a temporary space. Thirdly, the AC in the room doesn't have a switch on or off button, fan speed button, etc. and can barely be controlled manually. So through the night our AC barely worked and we couldn't do anything about it, needless to say we didn't sleep very well.  However, they do have a tonne of restaurants & bars at the property which was fairly impressive. We went to Nuga Gama for dinner where the appams were to die for. Definitely one of the best","Date of stay: October 2019"

It was a wonderful experience for many reasons. The venue itself was spacious and well-lit. The air-conditioning was super-efficient. The seating was organized in a way that avoided crowding while also affording guests the opportunity to move around easily. Service was excellent- the waiters were obviously well-trained, and unobtrusively moved around so your drink or refill were just moments away. The food was good too (especially the spread of desserts).   I compliment the management and staff of the Cinnamon Grand for helping my uncle (Dr. K C) organize an evening that was memorable for all the guests. Although I was not closely involved with the planning of the event, I do know that","Date of stay: September 2019"

Lots of restaurants and bars within the hotel and if you have concerns following the security issues earlier in the year, security now has been stepped up. We only stayed for two nights, check-in took longer than you'd expect but was fine and the room was clean but beginning to look a little dated (not helped that I'd just spent 4 nights in a brand new hotel in Dubai). One big plus for me was the Sri Lankan restaurant onsite called ""Nugagam"", it was a bizarre experience in many ways as its basically outside, on sand, with a VERY authentic feel to it, literally you would never believe you were still (technically) inside a 5* hotel.  Myself and a couple of work colleagues obviously had no idea what","Date of stay: September 2019"

The staff (kudos to managers Udaya, Keerthi, Mangala et al.) are exemplified by the courteous smiling efficient service of the likes of Anuradha - a gem of a steward.

For the second week my partner had to be in Colombo for work and she was provided with accommodation at the Cinnamon Grand by her host. Having known Cinnamon Grand and its history from its early days I had a mixture of nostalgia and anticipation as I came in.  It's located conveniently on the Galle road few minutes’ walk from the Galle face green close to many of the attractions in Colombo.
