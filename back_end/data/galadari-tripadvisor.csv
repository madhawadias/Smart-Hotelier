aries1321	Good Hotel...Zero Hospitality	"We stayed at Galadari with family in Jan 2020. The reception area is really grand and has perfect setting  of a 5 star hotel. However, the hospitality towards guests is pathetic. There is no good morning/evening/afternoon wishes; just statues waiting at the door with the no smile. Coming to the reception, it took around half an hour for us to get checked-in. The girls at reception were interns and  both of them had least interest in checking in. the general attitude of the staff was , we are giving you an opportunity to stay with us. After getting our rooms, we noticed there were no towels and the flush was not working as well. The flush issue was resolved by the engineer in an hour but we didn't get any towels for the 2 days we stayed there. The room service is as good as no; I"	Date of stay: January 2020

Rossana K	A stay to remember	This is a hotel wonderfully located in a key area of Colombo. The rooms are comfortable and the staff is always looking after your needs. The Coffee Shop has a delicious variety of food. We start the morning with a good breakfast and everyone looking after  especially Sanduni who will arrange every detail always with a warm smile.	Date of stay: March 2020
Sabeeha S	Sanduni from the coffee shop is great!	We went for the Sunday lunch buffet and Sanduni s service was top notch!  Truly recommend you hire more people like her.  The lunch buffet also had a lot of seafood options and a huge variety.  Dessert could be better though!	Date of stay: February 2020
chryshp	High Tea	"We went for the high tea to Galadari Hotel. It was extremely great. So much of variety of food. It is a mixture of Short eats,pastas,sandwiches ,sushi, pizza’s, iced drinks ?coffee, tea and the sweet counter is amazing. A group of friends met and it was an enjoyable day. A big thank you to the staff who were very helpful. It is certainly value for money. Any visitor to Sri Lanka high tea is a must."	Date of stay: February 2020
Bob A	Great centrally located choice with excellent service	"I stayed here as I was attending a wedding reception being held at the hotel and wanted to stay as close as possible to the venue.  I looked at hotels in the area and this was the best overall value for a decent quality hotel and for the location.  My stay started at Colombo airport where I approached the hotel's dedicated desk in arrivals looking for help to get me into Colombo as quickly as possible. My plane had arrived late and I had to get to an appointment after dropping my bags. They arrange d taxi for me with excellent service from the hotel. Unfortunately the car broke down on the way so they summoned a separate car and got me to the hotel. They had rung ahead and on arrival I was met at the door and helped with my bags, checked in rapidly and taken up to my room to get"	Date of stay: January 2020

GaoAnTian	Vastly disappointing high tea	"This was a very great disappointment. Just a buffet with normal foods, not special, and not all that good. The atmosphere felt like a crowded cafeteria. There was no special ambiance. And not even tea that I could find, just coffee and juice. Finally at the end I saw some green tea bags. What a disappointment."	Date of stay: February 2020

Asmma	"Appreciation for Sanduni at breakfast service (Coffee Shop, Galadari Hotel)"	"Galadari Hotel has been our temporary home for a couple of weeks. Everyday we have had breakfast at the Coffee Shop. While the overall service has been good, I would like to give special mention to one of the servers, Sanduni. I have observed her to be the most efficient and helpful server during the chaotic breakfast time. Always proactively asking if we needed anything and working dedicatedly. Here's thanking her and the entire team at the Coffee Shop."	Date of stay: January 2020
abhishek4d	Due for renovation	"I had stayed in this hotel for two nights on a family vacation trip. The location of hotel is simply marvellous. Situated on the sea shore, the rooms provide magnificent view of the ocean waters right outside. Staff is very courteous. The variety of food served in the restaurant is splendid. The welcome area and the reception are really grand! While the services and location are second to none, the age of the hotel was pretty much evident from the blackened and cracked walls of swimming pool, old bell type lifts, inefficient cooling in the rooms and aged furniture and bathroom fixtures. The hotel needs quick renovation to be able to provide all round pleasure to its guests and compete with neighbouring Kingsbury, Shangri-la, cinnamon etc hotels."	Date of stay: January 2020
Gagandeep Bindra	Poorly Managed Hotel	"We checked in on 22 Jan 2020  It took 25 mins to give us the room.  only one switch board in the room.  No towels in the room.  Bathtub was not cleaned properly.  Reception changed our room. 2nd room had problem in WC. Again room changed. It took 3 hrs in this. Finally got a decent room. Hotel needs so much of renovation. Lobby manager ( male- working till 9 PM) was nice who tried to help us in all this. Indian restaurant manager was very nice. Good food in restaurant.  Next morning - restaurant for buffet breakfast- it was again over crowded, poorly managed fnb.  They were just clearing the plates from the table. We asked for water and they showed us the way. That is not the service one expects from a 5 star hotel.   The biggest asset for this hotel is only and only their"	Date of stay: January 2020

Kalpna K	"Stay at Galadari, Colombo"	"Galadari location is superb, standing alongside with other top graded hotels in the same stretch; out of all Galadari has the benefit of getting full and un-interrupted view over Galle Face and Port City also . Most of the amenities are walking distance such as One Galle Mall (catering branded to local products of high standards)   Our room view was excellent facing Galle face and Port city. Considering hotel location and structure many room benefit from similar views.   Property does require some uplift and we heard that a well-known group was in talks of taking over and which will be a huge plus and both parties will hugely benefit.  We stayed eight nights to attend business matters - all worked out good for us, food was great, staff were very helpful, frontline managers –"	Date of stay: December 2019

S Jay	High Tea Buffet with an extensive spread!	"The high tea buffet at Galadari (on a Saturday evening) was very impressive, with a spread ranging from juices, iced coffee, cut fruit, finger food, sandwich station, meat kebabs, dumplings, sushi, pasta, pizza, cakes, tarts, waffles, baked alaska etc. plus tea and coffee.  Food was flavoursome and very satisfactory.  Service was very efficient despite the fact that the restaurant was full and the staff were friendly and attentive.  The ambience was nice with live piano music in the background. The overall experience is well worth the price (Rs. 1820 nett per person).  It is recommended to make reservation ahead."

Anthony P	It's Best Days Are Behind It.	"When arriving at 3am the last words you want to hear at check-in are ""No"" and ""Sorry""! But these are exactly the words that I heard when I was told that the no-smoking room I had booked was not available. In fairness to the staff member, he did upgrade the room type, but it was not a good start - and that really set the tone for the stay. The hotel's halcyon days seem to be behind it, it is living on past reputation when there are many other properties in the near vicinity which are much better. The room and general decor is old and tired and the staff seem disinterested.  Overall I would not select this hotel again or recommend it to other travelers."	Date of stay: December 2019
Christine	Dinner at the Coffee Shop	"We were here for a dinner at the main restaurant. In terms of food, i had a feeling as it didn't have much choices for the price and the taste wasn't that great. The restaurant was jam packed on that day as it was during Christmas Time, so we couldn't get a chance to enjoy the food with great talk. Staff was very attentive in terms of their service. The restaurant and the entire hotel was vibrant in terms of wonderful Christmas decor and settings. All in all the experience was somethings to be cherished but wasn't up to the expectations."

Shehara Jayakody	Terrible Service of the Management & Staff	"As a regular customer at prominent star-class hotels in Colombo, it is very sad to see the massive decline in the levels of customer service at the Galadari, which is an area the Galadari used to be well known for.  While planning a special family dinner, we decided to hold it at the Galadari and hence first called the hotel on the phone.  In asking some basic details on the available offers and the seating arrangements, we were amazed at the rudeness in attitude and tone of the restaurant personnel in response. The individual maintained that the seating arrangements were not up for discussion and also amazingly said that the staff were too busy and did not have time to deal with telephone inquiries. This was repeated over 3 separate conversations with the hotel. This was truly"	Date of stay: December 2019

Pawan Verma	Nice and Pleasent stay	"The hotel seems to be very old gives a beautiful sea view. The stay was good, comfortable with some points to be taken care of, by the hotel management.  The rooms were clean, but the flush in WC was having issues,  Surprisingly they did put 2 water bottles of 500 ml each for 2 guests staying in the room. In the room tariff, you get complimentary services like Steam bath, Sona Bath, Pool, and Gym.  They serve a wide variety of cuisines in breakfast, they have buffet service and also serve Indian taste restaurant.  The location is very prime, its in the Fort Area, walking dispatch from the Sea Side."	Date of stay: December 2019
dilkie Umagiliya	Christas /Birthday Party	My yearly Christmas party is held at Rooftop California Grill. An ambiance unmatched over the years. A beautiful birds eye view of Colombo is exceptional at night. An Epicurean Menu that surpassed any. Live Retro music in the background is relaxing and but keeps the toes tapping. The white and blue theme of a frosty X’mas added to the festive air. The many course dinner served with paired wine was unbeatable. Chef Anushan exceeded and over reached his capability. Lovely evening with family and friends with Competent efficient service. Thank you Galadari Colombo	Date of stay: December 2019

Family_in_MA_US	Very dated rooms	"The lobby may look nice but the rooms are so dated that even calling it ""Soviet-era"" would be insulting to Soviets.  Carpets are old and while they may be clean you still don't want to walk with bare feet.  Furniture has seen better days.  The buffet is good but I get the feeling that all hotels in the area serve excellent buffets.  Service was ok and reasonably responsive."	Date of stay: November 2019

Holiday Guide magazine	Where History Meets Luxury	"First opened in 1984, the legendary Galadari Hotel quickly got known as the city’s most fashionable retreat and one of the best hotels in Colombo. The hotel underwent a major change when it changed its name from Galadari Meridien after 11 years of operations. Imbued with a sense of grandeur and elegance, the hotel now features 425 rooms and suites that flawlessly combine legacy with luxury.   Spread over an area of 3.8 acres, with a plethora of easily accessible urban and outdoor activities, guests of the property are within walking distance of Galle Face Green, a wide expanse of green facing the Indian Ocean that is ideal for picnics and other outdoor activities. The hotel is also walking distance from another popular tourist destination, the Dutch Hospital – a dining and"	Date of stay: November 2019
Bill	Had a disappointing experience.	"This was my second time at this hotel. Before I used to stayed in Colombo Hilton, Cinnamon and Kingsburry. I did the check in around 0030hrs and all things went fine and I was very happy due the staff and the nice surrounding and the music. When I entered to the room I noticed that there wasn’t any items in the mini bar as well as no water in the room. . I came down to the reception area and looked for the Duty Manager and unfortunately he wasn’t around. I shared my mini bar situation and I was replied that based on hotel policy they removed all minibbar items from every room.  Then I went up and waited for the requested water for more than 45 mins and slept. Next day morning I went for breakfast with my back pack trying to enter to the buffet breakfast area. And I was told that"	Date of stay: November 2019

Raj K	Nice location but service is sub par	"The hotel is located at a very central location in the Colombo fort area, just next to the Old Parliament building and very close to the beach. The rooms do look a bit old but are spacious and the views from the rooms facing the beach is quite stunning.   The buffet spread was okay but the staff in general are slack. We experienced an awkward situation that could have been easily avoided by the hotel staff. At the reception counter, one of the staffers reminded us to avail a 35% discount at the dinner buffet being offered to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the hotel. When we arrived at the restaurant that evening and casually mentioned this to the restaurant manager, Mr Yohan, he was extremely rude and bluntly told us that there is no such offer. We felt quite embarrassed"	Date of stay: October 2019

The hotel boasts spacious rooms that comfortably accommodated our family. Our room was clean with fragrant bed linen and towels which I have found nowhere to date. The breakfast buffet was OUT OF THIS WORLD (I couldn't make the font any bigger!) and I still miss it even after being home for nearly 3 weeks! You name it and it was on the menu! We had a beautiful sea-facing room which was a delight. Everyone on the staff was courteous, smiling and friendly and I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone.

It offered a good view of the ocean.  The furniture, paint, bathroom, carpets ect are all old out dated and dirty and need to be renovated.  The bathroom tap was leaking and had to call a plumber to get it fixed. The stain on the carpet proved that the AC leaked regularly.  The cabinet light and sockets didn't function at all.

But the hotel even it has a good location, rooms with great view of the ocean , the heritage old perlamant building and other nice thongs, but it gives you also some negative surprises. I booked and paid the executive room even it's exactly the same room of lower categories, just to enjoy the executive lounge which is mentioned on the hotel website that it's 24 hours serving drinks and snacks ... To be shocked on arrival to the 12th floor which is the executive floor that the executive lounge has been made a meeting room!!! I could accept that website it's not updated for years!

There were hardly any guests at the Restaurant whilst the Coffee Shop was overflowing with guests for the 'Sunday Buffet'. Mr.Raja and his able Host warmly welcomed us and promptly brought in the Menu Card after having got us seated very comfortably. We ordered some Ginger Beer and two Thali Rice dishes. One was a Mutton and the other was a Chicken. Both were extremely good, spicy especially the Mutton Curry. I was told that they were prepared by their Indian Chef. They also served two 'Ulundu Vadais'. They were just okay but not of high quality. The sambol accompaniment for the Vadai was also not all that good.

It was a transit stop for us checked in here on price consideration.  The positives hotel is very centrally located has a good view from the room that we were staying in. The breakfast was very good with the Chef going walking in the dinning hall talking to guests to ensure good service.

im_nitinrawat	Good location ... Old property	I stayed for 3 nights on official tour. The hotel is located at the ocean front and my room at 12th floor had views of the ocean.  The room is spacious but is old and needs refurbishment. The hotel staff is courteous and friendly. Food at the restaurant is tasty.  WiFi is ok. TV reception is bad. Bathroom is clean	Date of stay: April 2019

Laura W	Stuck in a time warp!	"We were put up in this hotel by Sri Lankan airlines after they over booked our flight home and were told that this hotel is one of the most famous, luxury, 5* hotels in the city. They told us they had booked a beach view, super deluxe room for us. Unfortunately, the reality couldn’t be more different...  Our room is musty, smoky and extremely dated with mould in the shower and a view over a warehouse/factory.  The decor is more 3* 1980s than 5* 2019...  We’re a family of four and were given a room with just one bed because every other room in this monster hotel is booked (really?!) Eventually we were offered something a little bigger but with the same rock hard, no frills beds, bare walls, even mouldier shower and factory view.   As for the buffet dinner....another time warp."

DudleyHerft	Stay at the Galadari Hotel	"We stayed for fourteen day at this beautiful hotel, our check in after midnight was good, we had a ninth floor room comfortable but very dated, the room needs a refit any way the view was good looking at Gale Face Green. Room service was very good as the house keeping., breakfast great, service at breakfast was very good for the first four days when you arrived for B/K the people would guide you to table bring you coffee or tea check up on you from time to time fill your coffee or tea if you needed it, after that they passed you by with out even looking at you, even when they had a jug of coffee  in there hand or stop when you looked up at them trying to get there attention. Will we stay again at the Galadari Hotel yes for a few days only."	Date of stay: March 2019

Jazz Yang	Worst Trip Experience In Srilanka	"Positives: Front office staff very friendly, during check-in applyed late check out until 2pm ,they are very glad to provide. Negatives: Applyed late check-out until 2pm, but around 12:30pm, I have went to my friend's room, once I came back, the room boy was cleaning my room, and he removed all my bags and luaage to one place, so no choice, i went for check-out. After check-out I went to the restaurant next to the hotel, after place the order, i'm going to pay, then find out my wallet not in my bag. So I made a complain at the hotel, since we are hurry to airport, so the hotel mentioned they will sent a official email for my complain,that is 14th Feb, that's the worst vallentines day I had. But today is end of Feb, still I didn't receive any reply or feedback."	Date of stay: February 2019
Paras77	A good stay in Colombo	We were here for two nights. The hotels have a wide array of different restaurants from which you can choose. They also have an Indian restaurant which is quite good. Other amenities are okay as they have a tennis court but no nets so the ball will drop from tue 1st floor. In an all a good stay can stay for a day but if you are looking for luxury try some other hotels.	Date of stay: February 2019

Greg49	Very very very tired	"The positives first, the staff are fantastic, and the food in the restaurant was of a high standard and plentiful. Now the negatives, whoever owns this hotel has not spent a penny on it in the last 30 years. The carpet in my room was disgusting, I couldn’t walk on it barefoot, the room desperately needed a coat of paint, wherever you looked, you could see this hotel is in dire need of a makeover. The location is good, but there’s plenty of other hotels within 200 meters of the property."	Date of stay: February 2019
Sharat Y	Incredible location	"We stayed in galadari for a couple of nights and our stay was value for money . It is located in the most hippy district of Colombo surrounded by many bars , cafes and the most coveted ministry of crab restaurant . The only negative about the hotel is the rooms are pretty old and some of them might need renovation. Apart from that the whole stay was great and we even had free rountrip shuttle to the Casino"	Date of stay: February 2019

On complaint they will tell you this is the best they could do. They can't change tem because it is controlled by Central temp controle unit. Poor quality... Don't come."	Date of stay: February 2019
Susan	Great stay for a great price	"I enjoyed my four night stay very much. Room spacious and comfortable; shower large and efficient - AND you didn't need a science degree to use it, Bathroom also great size and all very clean. Staff really helpful in all circumstances, Breakfast was great: choice of typical Sri Lankan, regional or general hotel fayre, Delicious coffee, great omelettes, fresh fruit, waffles, pastries - all good. Also ate in bar and food great. Wish I'd had more time to use the outdoor pool which was nicely deep at one end. For me, the best thing was the amazing treatments - reflexology, head massage and full body massage: not only an excellent price but very good quality. There are smarter hotels, decor wise, but you will pay for this. Given the price, I loved the Galadari and look forward to"	Date of stay: January 2019
prageethrj	Worst service ever!!!!	"We went for lunch this afternoon and it turned out to be a nightmare! Due to the roads being closed for independence day rehearsals we arrived to the hotel a bit later than we planned for. It was 1.45p.m and we were very surprised to find the restaurant deserted. There were only a few guests dining and on a normal weekend you would find the restaurant packed ...we had our 4 year old son with us so I had to get him fed before I got started with my lunch. While I was in the middle of lunch one of the staff members informed us that they will be closing the buffet shortly however there is no need to rush. Therefore we carried on with our lunch.To our surprise and dismay just after the staff member spoke to us, about 15 staff members walked into the restaurant and started clearing"	Date of stay: February 2019
Shruti-Pramod	Beachfront stay	"Stayed here 2 nights on Jan 23 & 24,2019 in room 436. The hotel has shops, bar, restaurants, conference halls etc.The view from my room was of the Indian ocean and this hotel is close to others nearby like the Shangri La and is located near the beachfront. The look of the hotel is quite dated and reminded me of the Titanic for some reason. Our room key card stopped working twice during mid stay and we had to go the reception again to get it working again. Upon arrival we were also served a welcome drink.  The bathroom however had a tap way too close to the floor without any bucket. Wonder how they expect guests to use it?"	Date of stay: January 2019

AST	"Tired, faded, past it."	"This place is well past its best before date.  It has pretensions of grandeur and its ballroom is quite nice but the bar is dated, dark and uninviting, the restaurant is OK and the rooms more like a shabby UK 3 star than a Sri Lankan 5 star.  The first room I was given absolutely stank of damp, musty, fusty ancient bathroom not niceness, it took a day to move me.  The pool is OK but bears more resemblance to a Council leisure centre than an upmarket hotel.  I certainly wouldn't go back."	Date of stay: January 2019

I have stayed at the hotel twice recently, and will be going back for another stint very soon. The hotel offers a quality that surpasses that of other hotels in Colombo in the same price category. Rooms are spacious, appropriately furnished, and with good facilities. Galadari staff can be placed amongst absolutely the best you can get anywhere in the world. They are polite, courteous, and efficient. Galadari also offers a variety of food types of high quality in its restaurants and also offers an excellent buffet breakfast and a lunch."

mazhad	Would have been lovely in its day	This hotel does have a grand feeling about it on entry but it doesn't take long to notice it is quite run down. Our room was acceptable. We were with a Tripadeal tour group and they obviously didn't have us in the best hotel in town. Would not recommend TripaDeal!! The hotel is pretty well located near the harbour and near the Old Dutch Hospital which has a couple of great restaurants. The pool on the rooftop was quite nice with a great view.

Hotel staff very helpful and plesant. Bufett type meals, fair selection. The main entrance lobby, bar and dining area is spacious and grand, if money was to be spent on the hotel, it would be worthy of 5 stars."	Date of stay: December 2018
Lorna	un-updated hotel	"I believe that it must suppose to be a decent place by design, however it gives a feeling of out-of-date on many aspects, e.g. stained carpet, blocken head board, etc.. Not mention a porter in the lobby to drag luggage and demand tips; sent an email to customer service regarding to airport picking up but not got answered... The only positive feeling during my stay is room service that was fast and accurate."	Date of stay: November 2018

covina7	Disappointed!	"We spent two days in your beautiful city recently but were really disappointed by our hotel stay. From the moment we stepped in, we could tell that it was not going to be pleasant. The staff at the reception could have been more friendly and welcoming.  The room was another big disappointment for a hotel of your reputation. The furniture was dated and the musty smell that hovered was seriously off-putting. The bathroom was in need of a makeover as. it looked uninviting and completely devoid of style. On our return, my husband realized that he'd left his glasses in the room, and promptly wrote an email. He requested that the glasses be sent to our home address and that the cost of shipping would be paid by us. We checked out on 25th November, and to date, there has been no reply."

Step out of the lift to head to your room and you are hit with the stench of stale cigarettes - I cannot remember the last time I have experienced this in my many years of travel especially at this level of hotel.  Once in room you could still smell stale cigarettes and given that ash trays and matches were supplied including in bathroom says it all .  As for the room  - very average for what we expected aas premium room.  First problem was tv did not work.  Then discovered safe did not work and thirdly the shower taps only worked on hot if you could call it that - cold water tap could not be turned.

Room was spacious and clean.  they had loads of options to dine in near the lobby, with live music.  the sea was right next to the hotel, and the hotel is opposite some presidential building were we had a lot of security around us.   Negative point would probably be the spa area, as if you wanted to take a massage it was in a public room, not private."	Date of stay: November 2018

Flight got into Sri-Lanka at 4am so room wasn't ready (check in was at 2pm) so my tour guide arranged an early check in (an additional 40 dollars) Apart from initial problems as the bed linen not being changed and the toilet not flushing (consequence of an early check in I guess) the service I received was brilliant. Staff opening lift doors for me and my girlfriend, showing as around the facilities and just being generally nice and prompt. But the crowning jewel was the food..... Seriously the breakfast buffet and the dinner buffet selection needs to be seen to be believed! Amazing choice and great tasting food.

Hansana W	Galadari High Tea	"The Galadari is a sort of every man's high tea. The food is something to run home and talk about, most of it is average, and none of it is bad. If you're just really hungry, there's the option of skipping lunch and just heading for this (we assume this is what most of the people here were doing, judging by the hordes), because essentially for Rs. 1800 you get to eat a lot of food.  If you are a food lover and love to try various foods this will be a good place to you. Food is not Bad actually but we cant rate as superb."	Date of stay: September 2018

While the bed was very comfortable, the furniture looked the same as it did 22 years ago when I last visited and the bathroom was very outdated and a bit mouldy. The worst part was the underlying cigarette smell in the room. On a positive note, we had the buffet for dinner and it was very good."	Date of stay: October 2018

And hospitality was great.  the good PR of the manager allocated to the high tea area on 13th October 2018. Even the other staff were very polite and great.  They were so obliging and even after finishing the high tea we had a chat (our group 22) they were so nice to allocate us a place in the reception area to sit and further chat.  The girl who served tea had lots of patience with us to serve our different requirements at different times.   So if u guys are looking for a place for high tea I mean like which place to go, please go to Hotel Galadari and no one will match their services and the spread.    thank you Galadari Hotel - we the happy customers who left with  unforgettable memories with your"	Date of stay: October 2018
Ajai S	Nice functional hotel	"We stayed here for two nights on the 16 & 17 August.  The hotel is nice, rooms adequate however the buffet spread was the best of all the places we stayed. With such a wide spread it would have been nice to have clear marking of vegetarian and non vegetarian food as we had to keep asking all the time and since eggs are non vegetarian it was all the more challenging. The location of the hotel is quite strategic near the beach and the shopping is also just a few 100 meters away.  Their tea shop has a wide variety of teas and at very reasonable prices. As a matter of fact their prices were significantly lower than some of the tea we purchased in the tea gardens that made us feel really cheated."	Date of stay: August 2018

Priyanath	A GREAT DISSAPOINTMENT	Six of us went to the Coffee Shop on 16th(Sunday) for the Buffet Lunch.The spread was not at all satisfactory.We do not eat beef.There was no other meat item except chicken which is a very common item.There was only mutton Biriyani. There were no action stations. We came here on the 1st of Sept also for lunch. That day there were many action stations.There were sea food kebabs many dishes of mutton and roast lamb.

Few mins later, an Arab came with a singlet and shorts and he was allowed to sit in the lounge. When I argued about this, the Manager told us the Arab was in-house guest.   Hotel Galadari, why the double standard? Treat your local citizens right cos they are the recurring customers for you!"	Date of stay: April 2018

k B	"centrally located, nice views of the sea, friendly staff"	"I stayed in the Galadari for 5 days to attend a conference. The hotel is centrally located, but it is a bit old, so rooms may need upgrading, including change of carpet and headboard. The breakfast buffet was a good assortment of breads, fruits, local dishes were available everyday. The staff were attentive and friendly.  There was a whole week of simultaneous conferences but they tried their best to respond to their guests needs. I was glad there was a Tea centre shop in the lobby, which solved our tea shopping needs, and the prices were same as malls including a 5% discount for checked in guests.  The dutch hospital mall which had restaurants was a 2 minute walk.  The room which we had a view of the beach. It was a relaxing stay."	Date of stay: August 2018
Pragash	Hotel for Business	"Located in the Best place where all the important office and restaurant are in. Building is very old. But recently inaugurated restaurant is very beautiful. I loved ""Hot Lime Juice"".  Lobby is little small for a big hotel."	Date of stay: August 2018
Uday Krishna	One Arrogant Hotel to Avoid!!!!!!!!!!	We were here with a trip to Sri Lanka and spent over 12 days at many properties but the worst kind of experience that can Happen was at Galadari. The management has no training on what hospitality and courtesy is. The experience.... One you book a hotel and check-in none of the hotels here asked for any credit card or any financial information that could be used to block a certain amount of money on your card anticipating that you would use in house services and would charge the card automatically...  What kind of anticipation is this..... You simply sign the bills and have them charged during Check out.. That's the normal policy of every hotel.. These guys call up after 10pm asking the bill to be settled immediately.... We were like why don't you charge it to the room and will	Date of stay: August 2018
Kalpanie	Poor service	"Some staff at the hotel did not even respond to the questions asked from them. When informed that the soup spoon is too hot dipped in the soup bowl, the person at the buffet ignored and left not atleast saying that they can't assist. However there were few good staff I met at the hotel buffet as well."	Date of stay: August 2018

Krishnan_444	Disappointed !!	"me, my wife and our son stayed in this hotel during August 2018. I had high expectations about our stay as it was my fourth visit to this place and they always treated me well. When we arrived at the hotel nobody was there to receive us and we had to wait long hours in the lobby moreover They have n't served us a welcome drink which was included in our package. We booked one triple room with Sea view for a daily rate of $150 but they have allotted a double room and provided one extra bed which was unacceptable. After heated arguments with the manager, they have promised to give a triple room but they never fulfilled their promise. We had to stay all three days in that congested room having paid $150 per day which is a sizable amount. We had to ask multiple times for services"	Date of stay: August 2018

Location is really good as it is very near to the see side. I really like SPA services. The only thing I didn’t like is the room as it is very standard, which need to be updated ASAP.

Rahul Goel	Average stay...... Customer delight missing	"No welcome drink, your reception says they forgot, getting a room on the correct floor was a big problem. How can these guys give 2 separate beds to a family Guy with kids. Common sense should prevail guys.  Washroom flush was not working properly, was not clearing ?? poop, even flushing 3 times, was disgusting to complain and get no solution to it.   Our rooms fridges beverages was EVACUTED as soon as we checked into the hotel, saying some problem emergency in our room fridge, was funny and rediculous to hear after paying so much.   Rooms are  averagly fine, you will not see the staff greet you or smile at you. Every one works to finish their duty, CUSTOMER DELIGHT Is missing.  Also at the time of checkin, my credit card was booked as security to the services I use, I paid Cash"	Date of stay: August 2018

Otherwise, the staff were very accommodating.  This hotel looks old compared to the others in Colombo. It’s pool gets no shade after midday and is loud with traffic noise. Almost no one uses it."

The staff is courteous but a little improvement in english speaking can be a added feature. One of the main highlights for us was the food. The dinner buffet was extravagant keeping in mind the kind of tourists they get. There was chinese, continental and indian spread. My parents were happy as they could devour some vegetarian indian food. Also we ate the next day at their indian restuarant which was superb and very much indian in their flavour. Overall a good experience and a must recommended place in colombo"	Date of stay: June 2018

The rooms are very spacious and neat, though old and needs maintenance particularly in the bathrooms, the sheets, the drapes and the bed are very comfortable. The breakfast at the Restaurant is really good, and the spread is excellent. The quality of the food was very good this time.

It was truly a wonderful experience. The staff including the Manager of the restaurant Mr. Jayatunga went out of their way to plan a menu for the vegetarians as well as the non vegetarians, with the final approval from me, of course. From the time we arrived in the evening, we had extremely personal service from Mr. Jayatunga and his friendly staff.  The setting of the restaurant was idyllic and we were instantly delighted on entering the restaurant. It was perfect, the decor was elegant and provided a very intimate setting for us to enjoy our meal.  The meal itself could not be faulted. The food was excellently prepared"	Date of stay: June 2018
Prabodha Daulagala	Dinner at Coffee Shop	The place is ok. Although why its called coffee shop when it serves main meals I have no idea.

Gary T	All that glitters is NOT gold!	"On entering this establishment one is impressed, however, a weary traveller is after a room that is clean, a comfortable bed and a decent shower. If as much care had been put into the room upkeep maintenance as in the lobby that would achieve the desired result. Alas, it was not the case. We were given a change of room from the 4 th floor as this room had an ashtray which certainly was not our list of must haves. The room on the 10 th floor was just as tired and in need of an update in both decor and bedding. We only had breakfast and compared to several other hotels during our tour of Sri Lanka fell well short on the variety AND quality of breakfast selection.  Even the staff of this establishment fell well short of the mark compared to the other hotels we visited. One plus is"	Date of stay: June 2018
Gohar I	False claiming of 5 star rating	"This hotel used to be a good superior one but with time it has not being refurbished and has definitely lost its glory.  From carpets to decor, bathrooms to rooms all need to be uplifted enormously so to make the rating justified as five star.  There must be a survey conducted for the rating of this hotel as people may falsely book this hotel online and will for sure not get value for their money."	Date of stay: June 2018

hughal	"Overpriced, grubby hotel with extemely poor standards"	This hotel is exceptionally poor . In desperate need of renovation . Every room I was shown smelt revolting ( mould ) with old shabby furniture and stinky curtains. The room looked like something from the 70's. The carpets simply haven't been cleaned for years. The towels smelt of bleach with frayed edges. Its not enough just to have a nice view and pretty helpful staff which it has but for a $100 USD  a night plus 30% taxes its terrible. The food is pretty excellant in Sri Lanka but Galadari failed to deliver even a decent breakfast. Better hotels are the Cinnamon Grand ( worth paying a little xtra ) and the Mandarina Hotel further down the Galle Road.	Date of stay: May 2018

The bathroom fixtures are all rusting, the tiles in the bathroom are very dated and the inside of the bathtub is stained and peeling.  The carpet in the corridors is all worn that you can feel the concrete floor beneath. The gold plated elevator doors are disgusting and rusted. The only area that looks nice in this hotel is the lobby area. The breakfast buffet is reasonably good but could be better. The hotel is in a good location but not worth the money. This is definitely not a 4 star as it claims to be. It is no more than a 2 star considering the condition of the rooms. Even a 2 star in the US is a whole lot better than this hotel. I would not stay"	Date of stay: January 2018

Afterwards we wanted to take a picture together as one of them is leaving the island tonight. We kindly requested an employee who was standing idle at the lobby to take a picture of us. For our utmost shock he was very offended and replied rudely saying ""ask a security guard to take pictures"". We have never taken pictures there before but this time, it was an important memory for us. When we asked another employee, he too went away but very politely saying that he was busy. We can understand that. But regarding the first incident; I must say that we never expected such rude reactions by an employee at Galadari where we"	Date of stay: May 2018

The main discomfort was needing an extension cord due to no power socket In the bathroom.  It took a couple of days to get this.  We would recommend that a hotel of this level have enough available to guests who need them, or upgrade the bathroom.  Also, the bar and dining areas were extremely cold.

Krunal J	Needs maintenance	Pro: This hotel is situated at a very good location and has a very nice view if you could get the front side rooms on 10th plus floor. We were lucky to stay their just before the independent day (4th feb)and saw the parade. Cons: Don't expect 5 Star facility as it's a very old facility which needs considerable revamp.  It's always crowded with business meetings and hence you will see lots of people during breakfast or in lobby. It gave us feeling that we are also on a business tour.  No play area for kids. Swimming pool is there without temperature controls.	Date of stay: February 2018

Definitely needs an upgrade as rooms look tired, smell of cigarettes need to be evaporated and overall the hotel needs to be relifted.  Very busy hotel as there was a conference at the same time. Some of the guests thought they were at home and were taking buffet items with their hands.  I would recommend this hotel however as the competition increases this hotel may lose out on that basis. 4* is for the nice pool, good staff service and good variety of food at breakfast."

nsrgtrivedi	Average rooms Average Service	"This seems ro be an old property, averagely maintained, not upgraded up to the current standards. Service is average too. Service staff isn’t rude but non-co-operative. Although hotel’s location is good but there are other very good hotels nearby with probably the same rates as this hotel. Flavors Indian restaurant is good here, offering authentic indian food."	Date of stay: January 2018

Pinkal01	Nice in Colombo	"Galadari hotel is nearly off side of sea & creating port city area which will be most iconic of the city area.  The hotel provides all amenities you.  Room interior is very old.  Breakfast is superb arrangements.  Hotel service is good but very slow.  I called for drinking water 5 times, bath towel not getting after all called. Nice lounge area with some accessories shop.    Need some improvement services. Good hotels in Colombo."	Date of stay: January 2018
Rajesh P	Good Service but not rooms	"The hotel is located strategically in a very good location in the heart of Colombo down town. The front desk, checkin procedure was very smooth and staff was highly supportive but the biggest surprise was the ""outdated"" nature of rooms, small bathrooms, old wash basins, smalls bath tubs and overall interiors. Rooms were spacious for a family of 4 but definitely can score better if interiors are done better. That is where the hotel has to concentrate on to be able to stay in the competition in a growing tourism industry. We took 3 rooms and AC was not working effectively for 2 of them. Overall average stay experience."	Date of stay: December 2017
HimanshuNachane	Good for business trips	"This hotel has a good ambiance, nice restaurants and lies in Colombo city, however it is primarily a business hotel, at least that's what i came across from my experience. The rooms are specious but have vintage look. The amenities are good, but you will be continuously reminded of the period hotel look and feel. It has a good food options and the mornings are busy mostly by business discussions so a tourist might feel out of place. the seating is also cramped for breakfast.  The good part is, the staff is helpful, it is very near to the city and one can easily stroll in the nearby areas.  From a quick stay perspective or for a business trip this is a perfect hotel however if you are with family and want to stay for leisure, this might not be a right choice."

averrhoes2015	"Excellent staff, good food, excellent location, spacious rooms"	"Although the rooms look ancient which needs updating like decoration and good finishing, they are spacious and adequately furnished. Beds are comfortable. The reception staff are excellent. The Wi-Fi was strong. Tea and coffee making facilities was a bonus. The location is very good. The hotels as restaurants of different varieties which serve delicious dishes. The breakfast was amazing offering varieties of food and fresh fruits and vegetables which suit any cultural background. In this trip we stayed twice and we were very pleased. We recommend this hotel."	Date of stay: January 2018

mk4343	Dated Hotel	"Other than the lobby, the hotel looks and feels old. It does not look like any refurbishment has been done for the last 10-15 years. The buffet breakfast is below average - I cannot recall any item that good. Other than the location, this hotel bad. My room was on the 4th floor and could not see the ocean properly.  I spend close to $180 for a night and did not get value for money. There are many hotels next to Galadari and I am sure they are about the same cost."	Date of stay: December 2017

The drinks are great, shisha is perfect. There is no other shisha lounge like this in Sri Lanka."	Date of stay: January 2018
StephensN0325	Very bad service and bad quality	"I'm Stephens, Executive Sous Chef in a leading hotel in London. I'm on a holiday here. I came to have a coffee yesterday ( Friday 5th Jan 2018) . I was sitting at lobby bar more than 20 mins and hardly see no one is coming to our table. Finally I asked someone (waiter)to come and help us. He gave the menu and I ordered two Late s and one green tea. OMG.. Late was cold and green tea like just water and no colour, no taste nothing.  This is a shame .. this hotel look like a normal shop at the payment now. No quality and such a bad service as well. Managers.. please check and see rather than walking with you coat here and there. I came to this hotel after 18 years. Thank you."	Date of stay: January 2018
NataliePatricia	Old is not gold	"From the outside this place looks quite impressive and grand but unfortunately is simply “lipstick on a pig”.  Arrived late after long flight with delays and simply wanted to get to room to sleep. Lengthy check in process with passports and various paperwork required before finally getting our key. Skipped dinner to head straight to bed.  To our dismay we were faced with a smoking room stinking of cigarettes. We requested a change but had to wait around aimlessly to get new room key. Other room not much better as musty smelling, filthy old carpets and stuffy air conditioning. No views or scenery to make it worthwhile.  Our group all had bad experiences with their rooms including foul carpet, late night phone calls from reception and phantom alarm clock going off at 3 in the"	Date of stay: January 2018
Martha B	Somewhat dreary old hotel	This hotel is a Colombo fixture and was a hopping spot for the party crowd during our Christmas holiday stay. But the room was in dire need of updating—carpet is hideous and was soaking wet where the AC dripped on it—room was way too cold as well. Breakfast buffet was ok but nothing wonderful.

Amila F	Christmas Day Dinner that needs more varity	Went for the Christmas day dinner but the selection was not rich as expected from a super hotel in Colombo. No pork varieties at all.

"central location with wifi, gym, and other facilities but i'd say that the rooms are aged. carpet for example can be changed. looks and feels a little dirty (you may want to have your own pair of bedroom slippers). breakfast was ok but a more international offering would be good. overall, i'd say not v good value for money."

However, the building and it's rooms are looking a bit shabby and there is massive land reclamation and building in progress just 100yards from the hotel, right on the sea front. The work continued throughout the day and night, and after a complaint, we were pleased to be from our 4th floor seafacing room to an upper executive floor for the second night of our stay.  The buffet breakfast was very good, with plenty of choice for all nationalities"	Date of stay: November 2017
Venkatraman	Good hotel near the sea	Pros- 1) Location: It is located opposite to the Colombo coast.The rooms offer superb views in the morning. 2)Friendly staff: The staff are warm and courteous and everyone understands English. 3)Swimming pool with sauna is excellent. Cons- 1)Once upon a time it was very good.Now the corridors and rooms are starting to get old. 2)Vegetarian dishes for both breakfast and dinner are very less.Tough luck if you are a veggie.

The rooms are good and the food was also of acceptable quality. The break fast buffet menu was well spread.  Overall, a good experience."	Date of stay: October 2017

Nice and friendly staff, rooms standard with standard equipment. The main restaurant, there are more, serve a buffet which is a bit tasteless. They have courses from all over the world but the mix doesnt differ much from one course to the next. Breakfast plentiful and again from all over the world."	Date of stay: November 2017

Asish C	Well Located Hotel but need to change the furnitures & fixtures	"The location of the property is quiet good & very near to the beach. Unfortunately the view of the ocean has been blocked due to the new port city coming up. The hotel is quiet old & the furniture's are quiet old & makes quiet a lot of sound. The rooms are nothing great for the price they charge. In fact hotel prices @ Colombo are quiet overpriced. Coffee chop where the breakfast is served is quiet small to accommodate all guests during rush hours. The food is not so good. Tried the Indian restaurant, nothing great & so is the rom service. Choice of food in the room service menu is also quiet restricted. Over all the hotel is average but quiet overpriced."	Date of stay: October 2017

Iloveexpensivestuff	Great location but dated. Needs lots of updates	"Check in was painful. We had booked 2 non smoking rooms and they tried to slip us smoking rooms but we refused to accept them. Then they made us wait 40 mins for our rooms and when they finally gave us one room on the non smoking floor, it turned out someone had smoked in it and it stank. After waiting another 30 mins someone came to spray the room but we never got a change of room.   The rooms themselves are quite dated and look run down. They have dirty carpets on the floor which need replaced.   Breakfast was just ok. Nothing out of the ordinary.   Don’t stay here if you need good quality."	Date of stay: October 2017

Before we chose to stay here we met the guest relations officer, Lasandhi, who was a gracious young lady who showed us around. On the basis of this tour, we were convinced that this was the place stay. We had been travelling for over two months and had experienced a range of hotels from 3 to 5 star in Sri Lanka and the Galadari did not disappoint. From the outset, the staff made an effort to make us feel special. Of particular mention are the reception and front of house staff, and the assistant Manager of Food and Beverage, Mr Ajantha Warawita.  He paid special attention to our dining experience at every opportunity.   We have been very pleased with the quality of food and table service.  The breakfast and"	Date of stay: October 2017

This was the second visit to the same restaurant but compared to the 1st visit, it was sad to see how their service levels, food, hygiene has gone down. The waiter by the name ""Rohitha"" was extremely unprofessional and rude. The order took too long to arrive after that was even after several reminders. The food didn't taste good at all. I was looking for the Manager to complain but he was very busy with his own work.Will not even visit to this hotel again. Very disappointed."	Date of stay: September 2017

The place continues to develop and there are still a lot of places that look old and frontages need to be upgraded to give the city a more modern look.

We were all in formal attire and one friend was in traditional Indian attire. When we entered Margarita Blue there was no one inside and a staff member approached us and said we couldn't enter because there was a no slippers policy. I explained to him that flip flops and shorts is one thing but wearing Indian sandals with traditional Indian clothing should be considered smart casual. He refused and i asked to speak to his superior. Another staff member from the bar came and flatly refused.   I was getting frustrated since i was unable to get the message across that we were all in suits and one guy was in Indian attire.  So we went to the reception and spoke	Date of stay: August 2017

Beds are average and bathroom toiletries are average. Air-conditioning is good which is a good thing as the heat in Colombo is stifling.  The hotel is near the old Dutch hospital area so food is easy to find. The buffet breakfast is also food with a variety of local, Indian and western food.

The positive is that the room was kept clean and the staff are excellent and very friendly and nothing is too much trouble - Mr Thusitha Liyanaarachchi in particular was extremely helpful and made our stay enjoyable.

Dust filled A/C vents in bedrooms and unclean carpets in the hallways are not really the way an expensive hotel should be run. Galadari is not cheap by any means. Room rates are very much international but the hotel is declining rapidly. There were no slippers nor bathrobes in the rooms. No toothbrushes or Conditioner. All signs of cost cutting but still charging the full 5 star room rates. As a very frequent hotel stayer, I do look for the signs that indicate the management is trying to cut costs but not passing on the savings to the guests. Food is also overpriced.

Tracey O	Old and Tired	Unfortunately this hotel has passed its prime........  The bars and restaurants are old fashioned and out dated.  Many of the staff wear dinner jackets and bow ties and I kept waiting for the 80's soundtrack to accompany the decor.  Our room was clean and pleasant enough but again stuck in an 80's time warp.    The aircon is set far too cold.  I had to return to our room to collect cardigans/jumpers to be able to sit in the bar for any length of time.  We ate in the restaurant selling Indian food which was ok apart from the menu displayed out side was different to the one given to us at the table.  We thought we'd treat ourselves staying in a 4* hotel but to be honest it wasn't worth the money.	Date of stay: March 2017

Staffs in reception and restaurant were rude and confused, felt like all of them got recruited on that day. I will not recommend anyone to stay here unless they increase their service and decoration. It is hardly a three start hotel (they are calling 5 star !!). Only positive was their food in one of the restaurant which was good (but it was valentine special so dont know about regular buffet)."

boski	Café 64 Galadari hotel Colombo – old and cheap	"We went here for a quick meal after drinking at the Kingsbury as its just across the road. The outdoor Roti stalls looked and smelt great. We went inside to investigate the middle eastern food restaurant but it was empty of customers and the staff looked asleep. We were not surprised to see how very old and sad and out dated this hotel looks no money spent on this places for decades and it’s still an expensive place to stay. With all the new hotels opening up in Colombo no surprise if this place closes its doors. The Roti stands seemed like the best option for a quick, cheap and healthy food, my husband and I both ate a healthy meal of vege dishes and naan bread for well under $5.00 so we were happy but hard to return after seeing the inside."

deepakstephen	Old fashioned decent place overlooking the ocean	"Galadari is right behind WTC and guests can see the vast Indian Ocean from most of the rooms. The place is old fashioned but with all the facilities that one can expect from a modern hotel. The continental cuisine was quite good. The location is perfect for partying, dining and shopping."

Paul S	The staff make all the differance	"visiting after two years. The tired old lady should be getting a facelift in the nearest future. The staff more than makeup for the lack of freshening up the décor. Warm smiles, ever eager to serve and please at all touch points. This is a grand hotel with one of the best ocean views built in an American style and still boasts one of the best breakfast and high tea feasts on the island"	Date of stay: March 2017

Rooms are badly built, You will always find some or other faults either in the washrooms or in the rooms. Initaaly they have given us a very badly lit room and made excuse that some guests prefer that way. Breakfast are very bad, same (South Indian) menu everyday. To use Tennis Court they charge 1000LKR for Racket. Services are very bad , for some floor they provide tooth kit , for some floor they dont."	Date of stay: December 2016

Elin N	Not as good as the reviews says	"Worn rooms and the hotel need an Upgrade. Not to be considered more than a 3 star hotel, even if they have bar and restaurant, and some shops. Swimmingpool on one of the top floors under roof ... No rooms with balcony. A huge hotel without  charm or atmosphere. Close to Dutch Hospital and good location."	Date of stay: February 2017

FireHat	Grand 5 star hotel!	"Well, I stayed in this hotel just for 3 days, but I think the service was great. The rooms were spacious and tidy and the bathrooms were sizable and the food was varied and suitable for every palette. I stayed in this hotel last month and it was a truly grand experience! It was a family trip and even the kids enjoyed their stay.  The pool was clean and there was a small pool for the kids. We got a room in the 8th floor and the city view was awesome. I guess this is one of the best 5 star deals you can get in Sri Lanka."	Date of stay: January 2017

Anubha S	A standard 5 star hotel	"This place is a standard old school multi star hotel and is luxurious, clean, multi-facility enabled. Their grand buffet at the coffee shop is apparently most famous and worth a try. We were however very disappointed that during our visit their  swimming pool was closed down for renovation and they kept misleading us about the time of its reopening. Ideally they should have arranged for pool facilities in nearby hotels  (since we were paying a bomb). Also, considering they get a lot of international tourists their massage facilities for women close down by 4 PM!! (However remains open for men till 9 PM). I would say that there are a lot of other similar facilities in the vicinity."	Date of stay: January 2017
Jessica W	"Average in everything- breakfast, room, service."	"The hotel was situated at about 8 minutes walk to work the Dutch hospital. It was quite outdated.

The breakfast had a choice of western, Indian and Sri Lankan."	Date of stay: February 2017
Miyuru W	Dinner buffet at Coffee shop.	One of Colombo's oldest still is one of its best! The ambience here isn't much. At least when I went there for their dinner buffet. But the buffet! Oh my! Superb selection for appetizers and main courses! Love the selection of buns and baguettes here too. The tomato bun was so nice and I've never had anything like that before. As for the main courses the choice is extensive. Ranging from Sri Lankan to eastern to continental. The dishes are nicely decorated and very tasty! The live BBQ and Pasta counters here as standard just add to the value! Desserts are awesome! Selection is so wide and love the Tiramisu and Panna Cotta here! Best I've tasted so far.. The Ice cream counter is superb for any dir hard ice cream fan cause you get to make your custom sundae with all the stuff you	Date of stay: February 2017

The lobby of the hotel is huge and has very good feel. However the rooms are rather old. Also I was on the executive club floor but there was no separate check in and the lounge was closed throughout my stay there. The shops downstairs are so so. I went for a head massage at one of the shops downstairs and they told me to come back later, and then said they will call my room to tell me when to come down but they never called."

The room that was given to us was in horrible conditions. The wall paper was torn and coming out from various places in the room, the carpet was stained and smelly, clock placed on the table was old and discoloured, mattress was worn and threads coming out, cockroaches in the room and the bathroom, bathroom fittings were old and broken, the bath fittings had rust on it, bathroom ceiling was chipped and coming out.

The main attraction of this property is their Lobby. It's very big and was well decorated for new year. But the moment you enter into room, a very foul smell enters into your nostrils. Shabby, dirty and old carpets were on floor and in the corridors. It's nauseating. We sprayed perfume in the room to survive. They promised to change the room towards sunny side , but didn't. As it was new year time and guests keep pouring in . However roooms were big and toilet was ok. They have lovely rooftop pool , Spa centre , tennis court and other options.

DrVRaj	Time for a renovation	The hotel is in the heart of Colombo and if you get a room with the view overlooking the sea it is splendid.  The rooms are in need of an uplift - but I guess being a busy hotel the renovation is going to be a difficult undertaking. Service from staff was absolutely great.  The staff at the breakfast buffet seem rushed - but again I am a bit puzzled that people complain of lack of service - A buffet is meant to be a self service concept. But people don't move from the table and keep asking staff to get them their food and then complain that staff are not cleaning up the tables promptly. High Tea was great. All in all was a great trip and the service at the hotel can't be faulted at all but as with everything it's time the hotel undertakes some renovation.	Date of stay: December 2016

Carlos	This hotel needs an upgrading.	We stayed 5 nights over the new year. Got a room on the 10th floor with a good view of the Gall Face green and the sea. That is the good part of the room. Check in was fast. Room size is good. I would say large for a double occupancy.  On entering the room we found underwear left on the floor by the previous occupant. Careless house keeping. Had to call them up to draw their attention and have it picked up.The carpet was never vacuumed as there were traces of dirt over the period we stayed. The rooms need an urgent renovation. Carpet was dirty and stained. Furniture made of cane and used over the years. Bathroom was clean but tired and needed an urgent uplift. In room safe is available. Tea and coffee maker and replenishments available. The in room lighting was very poor to say	Date of stay: December 2016
Leona A	"Average hotel, amazing act of honesty and integrity by hotel staff"	"I stayed at the Galadari in November 2016.  On check out, I accidentally left my gold jewelry in the hotel safe. I realized that my jewelry was missing only after getting back to Montreal 2 days later.  I immediately got in touch with a friend of mine in Sri Lanka who called the hotel and was told that the jewelry had been handed over to lost and found.  After I emailed a description of the jewelry and with a letter of authorization my friend was able to pick up the jewelry on my behalf.  I am extremely grateful for the honesty and integrity of the hotel staff who found the jewelry and turned it in, intact.  I am giving the property an average rating as I feel that a better job could be done in the cleaning department, especially the toilets and though the food at the breakfast"	Date of stay: November 2016
AmericanCareerExpat	Needs Upgrading	"I""m surprised this is considered a five star, even by Sri Lankan standards. I agree with other reviewers that the carpet is badly in need of an upgrade. Good thing I had my flip flops because I did not want to walk without them.The food experience was average, if that. The hotel staff was lovely, smiling and helpful so I hate to write this kind of review but avoid this hotel if you can."	Date of stay: January 2017
Nisansala R	Good location for the price	I've stayed at Galadari Hotel a few times. The rooms are too dated for my taste and in need of an update with good interior design. Bathrooms are also not the best with some leaking water through the shower cubicle. Do NOT depend on the hairdryer in the room as it is quite old with barely enough power to dry your hair.   Room service is quite good with staff willing to cater some dishes to your specific needs. Breakfast buffet however was far behind the standards maintained in other hotels in the stretch. I found the service to be quite average as well.   This is a good hotel if you want to find a cheaper rate around Galle Face area and some rooms have really good ocean and city views.

vandita l	Good but need lots of improvements	"The hotel gave a very warm welcome but the joy was short as when we went to our room we were disappointed. We got a smoking room which had a very dirty and stinky carpet. (No one smokes in my family). We couldn't walk bare foot in the room as our sole we're becoming blackish). The shower leaks, very old hair dryer, no body lotion in the bathroom. I was with my 4 months old baby and I had to protect her from inconveniences. At the restaurant the waiters were very slow. We waited for a tea for 15 minutes during breakfast. I could recommend the hotel if you have a very short stay but if you are in holiday then don't spoil it. Avoid this hotel.  The food were good though."	Date of stay: December 2016

"We had a week-long visit for a conference and then a return several weeks later for one day to catch our flight home after holidays in the region. The first airport pick-up was missed, but otherwise the first stay was uneventful - until we were leaving. The room adequate, the food and service acceptable - although their concept of a Reuben sandwich was way off. The trouble started as we were leaving after the first week. I wanted to ensure that the airport pick-up for our return wasn't missed again since we were arriving on a midnight flight. They said that they could not do it - I had to e-mail. The next issue was much more serious. Usually I do not let anyone near my computer bag. An eager porter insisted on taking my computer bag. I resisted and he kept pulling at it.

Whilst the lobby area is all nice and neat ..once you get up to the rooms the picture changes.  Mouldy wallpaper, shabby carpets, smelly bed linnen, poor electrical connections, and terrible air-conditioning.  Most infuriating was the unstable wifi signal requiring constant re-connecting, and the different wifi networks within the hotel ...sooooo outdated.

Basically the Gold Hotel name at the entrance is an indication of the let down to be expected. - Broken letter. Filthy stained carpets, pealed stained wall paper on rooms level corridors. Rooms again stained carpets, pealing wall paper, broken light sockets or lights that do not work. Bathroom........ Oh no!  eeks, I prefer to bath in a river or go for a sea bath. Filthy old bath tubs, broken mirrors, ventilator almost falling off. Taking you to breakfast - this should be controlled. Place packed with groups who monopolize the entire place.

We requested an iron and although it took time to arrive, it didn't hold us up. We didn't have breakfast (but I believe from Friends who did, it was good). Check out was quick and easy.

Bathroom wall had a crack. Bath fittings very shabby & worn out. Mould on the washbasin.Spa was a real shame. Poor standard of lockers with paint peeled of the tin doors. small shower rooms. useless steam room. No one would go there more than once.  Absolutely NO Quality experience.

The hotel might be a bit old and it shows in the furnishing and the rooms, but it was impeccably clean and the service was good also. The rooms are a bit gloomy, but quite spacious.   One highlight of my trip was definitely the food. Both the breakfast and the in house catering for the conference were excellent and quite varied.   One advice: Don't be intimidated by the signs telling you not to use any tuktuk. We asked the bell boy to get us a cab and it was very overpriced. It was much cheaper (and quite easy) to walk out and hail one of the metered tuktuks."	Date of stay: October 2016

Good selection of drinks but didn't appear to have local beer on draft. Free WiFi, slow to connect at first in the room but once connected it was fine.  Food in the restaurant excellent with a brilliant choice on the buffet.  Staff very friendly and helpful. Room was nice and comfortable with a lovely bed. Big bathroom with everything provided."

bavanthi a	"""Marguerita Blue"" a place to chill"	One of the coolest night clubs in town to chill..love the ambience and they play some pretty cool music too.  The drinks are quite reasonable and the blue margarita is my Fav.  If you wanna enjoy some good music and dance the night away...this is the place to be.  Its not so cramped up and have a seperate area for smoking...this place appeals more to the middle aged crowd than to the club hopping teenagers	Date of stay: September 2016

Pat T	Good food.Poor hygiene.	"I have always been a regular to have buffet high tea priced at Rs1,550 and buffet lunch priced at Rs 2,000 in the lobby area of the hotel.I have always enjoyed the food there and have felt very comfortable eating the food because it is a Muslim hotel and I knew the food I was getting was halal.I have not had a meal this  visit to the Island simply because I feel the food hygiene is poor. I found a long grey hair when I was eating a meat cutlet.This was alerted to the management. If a thing like this had happened in the UK they would not have charged for the meal.If that was not possible they would have given me a meal voucher to be used on my next visit to the restaurant."

JV Prasad	Decent Business hotel	Stayed here one night on our way out of Sri Lanka. Very business like hotel lacks the personal touch for a vacation. Rooms are nice with a wonderful view although the upholstery etc are a bit old. Restaurant options are many and the Indian restaurant (Flavours) food was very good although service was extremely slow.  Asked for printout of boarding passes and reception obliged however they had not informed us of the applicable charges earlier.  Would recommend mainly for business purpose.

Canuckimpressions	Busy hotel in Colombo	"Only stayed one night, but it seemed like a really popular and busy hotel. I am not a big fan of hotels that are this busy. Although on the whole it was not that bad. Not as clean as other hotels visit in Sri Lanka, but it was acceptable. Staff were very busy and had to wait an hour for the room even through we checked in late. They have a massive buffet which was pretty decent. If I had to visit Colombo again I would probably try a different hotel."	Date of stay: August 2016

Tasnuva A	Okayish Old Hotel	"The hotel is grand no doubt about it however it is very old now. We stayed on the top floors with a sea view, though the room was average size it was pretty old and the ceilings and the wall really showed the age. Breakfast time it was super duper crowded and food was very very average! One night we tried the Indian restaurant and I must say it was fantastic! However I enjoyed the location and you could just walk to the Dutch Hospital and some nearby areas! It gave me a feeling of Pan Pacific Sonargaon or Ruposhi Bangla in Dhaka!"	Date of stay: October 2015
Ceylon Alan	Very Good Buffet.	We met friends in the lobby bar then went across the room for buffet. The service was excellent and the buffet had a very wide selection. The was something for everyone. All very well cooked and tasty. Give it a try. It is in need of some renovation though. But that is a minor point.	Date of stay: August 2016
Eraj W	Disappointing	A popular rendezvous for evening tea. A fairly wide selection of dishes. But the food was very dry and the pastry items somewhat hard. It seemed like due to the high turnover the food was hurriedly made. Make sure you have a booking prior to going.	Date of stay: September 2016

Lloydperera	Go for the High Tea!	"The best thing about this hotel is their ""High Tea"". I think its cheaper than the one in Galle Face Hotel. The food was amazing and the staff was polite.  If i could make a suggestion i would tell that the hotel needs a total redesign starting from the exterior."	Date of stay: July 2016
ZiadKHALED	Good old hotel	"The hotel location is excellent. The staff are welcoming, cordial, helpfull and professional. The check-in was done in less than two minutes. There are 4 restaurants offering western, indian, srilankan AND arabic food. Yes arabic food! I have tried the arabic restaurant and it is very good. They have a sheesha lounge with an excellent staff. Sheesha is good .Could be much better if they renew their sheesha and make for each flavour a specific sheesha (for example apple flavour should be served on apple sheeshas only etc...). My wife she took her own sheesha to this lounge and they were ok with it as long as they charge for a full sheesha.  They also have a pool area, a gym, sauna and can offer massage therapy. The pool area has a view on the ocean and the roundabout next to tge"	Date of stay: August 2016
ASK_Dreamliner	Good Hotel and Great Views	"The hotel is located very close to the beach in Colombo and is just a 10 minutes walk to  Galle Face Green park. The hotel rooms are clean, well maintained and the staff is really friendly. The outdoor pool and sauna is a welcoming amenity after a day full of sightseeing. There are a few casinos you can visit close by and the staff is really very professional and helpful when it comes to helping tourists with sightseeing tours."	Date of stay: December 2015
Sampath Bandara	Sea view room is very nice	Spent one night here. Room was clean and tide. The view of Indian Ocean was breathtakingly beautiful. food was delicious  and the service was friendly.

J|\|D	Good Hotel	"The hotel location was near to markets and malls, and the beach, and the restaurant, but the rooms need improvements. The furniture looks old,  and the rooms and floors had a very bass smell. there is a  very nice coffee shop just at walking distance from hotel. amazing coffee and great ambiance.  I stayed 3 days in july and was there for Pakistan-Srilanka T20 Matches . The staff was so friendly and helpful thru the whole stay, few things can improve in the hotel."	Date of stay: September 2015
md1re	Very busy business hotel	"I attended a medical meeting here and the meeting facilities were very good. The location is good as this is within walking distance of the beach and the Dutch Hospital. The hotel is very busy and so check in took some time; we asked for our bags to be taken to the room, but after a long wait and no response to our phone calls we went and retrieved them ourselves. The bar was quite expensive. The breakfast was very busy but the food was OK."	Date of stay: August 2016
sharmakshat22	Service is Hopeless	The service is absolutely horrendous. No proper service in the rooms. You'll even have to call housekeeping for a bottle of water when you get back from work in the evening and they still refuse to give it!  They don't care how much you're paying or what so ever they'll choose to ignore you royally! Absolutely disappointing	Date of stay: August 2016

Lea T	uncomfortable	"Although the hotel location was near enough to markets and malls, and the restaurant (coffee shop within the hotel) was awesome and the food was good, but the rooms were very bad. The furniture was about 20 yrs old, the toilet was floated with water, and the rooms and floors had a very bas smell. Eventhough we stayed 3 days and we informed them about these issues, nothing was fixed. The staff was so friendly and helpful thru the whole stay, but the hotel needs to be improved."	Date of stay: August 2016
Harshana M	High Tea	High Tea @ Galadari is something that me and my family keeps on going when ever possible. Basically because of the price and the quantity. I think it is the most cheapest high tea in town with a huge variety. It's always crowded but they will serve all the items in the menu till the end of service; which is usually at 6PM. Best thing  about Galadari High Tea is the show cooking food. On any given time they have at least six chefs doing show cooking at high tea.	Date of stay: July 2016

Jaydeep Mehta	Avoid this Hotel	"Due to the long weekend of August 13 to 15, travelled to Colombo.  Reached at 10 pm.  Was allotted a room at 11.45 after a lot of coaxing.  Front manager executive Mr Denham and Lobby Manager Mr Dilan totally non cooperative.  They simply say, hotel is full, room cleaning is going on.  When I asked why room not being given even when we check in so late, no reply.  They say that you can go and complain.  Whom do we complain at 11 pm in the night.  Rooms are extremely outdated and always smell of smoke.   This cannot be a 3 or 4 star property.  Avoid this property..."	Date of stay: August 2016

Sati	Very warm staff	"Stayed for a week for training. Hotel is pretty old but stay was very memorable as it had a nice view of the ocean. I would like to commend the staff as everyone from the doorman to the front desk always made me feel comfortable and would always make small conversations with me. I personally love how after the first day, the chef remembered how I liked my omelette prepared every breakfast :)"	Date of stay: November 2015
leone33	"Old, smelly....very expensive. 1 star hotel"	"We got to the hotel expecting a 5 star hotel (having paid a 5 star price) and after a painful check in process we have been given an awful room (extremely smelly, dirty and old). We complained and have been upgraded to an executive suite, which was basically the same as the previous room but on a higher floor and of a larger size.   Don't know how hotels in Colombo are but this is not a 5 stars hotel. In Europe this would be barely a 1 stars.  Last thing if u wanna stay here for a night bring some blanket from home...it will be better for your night....maybe.  Positives: location, pool, very kind staff and good breakfast"	Date of stay: August 2016
AnirbanBasu	Beautifully located hotel facing the sea	The hotel is located in front of the Presidential Secretariat and facing the sea. There are shops and banks nearby. The hotel is about one hour drive from the airport through the highway. The hotel has a nice spread of food for breakfast and lunch. Wi-Fi though slow is available in the rooms and quite a number of TV Channels including few to cater to Indians are available for viewing. Walking on the beach in front of the hotel can be a pleasure	Date of stay: August 2016
SriramSP	"""Fantastic value for money"""	"Enjoyed our three day stay at Galadari-real value for money! One is spoilt for choice as the breakfast buffet spread includes south indian, continental,middle eastern delicacies with a good range of fruits, cakes and assortment of cheeses. Lunch and Dinner options are aplenty and not too expensive for a hotel of this category. Full marks for location, quick check in and friendly and prompt service. Our 11th floor room offered fantastic sea views and the location in the very heart of Colombo is a huge plus. Heartily recommended. Look forward to staying again soon!"	Date of stay: July 2016
Thanancheyan S	Buffet Lunch	"It was the third time I had been for lunch buffet at Galadari Colombo. Comparing last two visits, the taste of the food seams to be falling down drastically . Specially today we were a group of 13 bankers spilt through two different table arrangements where 10 people in series of continued tables and 3 people in another table away from the group. Keeping all these aside comes the funny hospitalization of the so called five star hotel. I was one of those three dining isolated form the group, picked soup had half way through and left rest of the half due to its horrible taste and followed the long queue impeded to serve lunch and got back to the table intending to be seated to enjoy the so called five star lunch.  Beyond surprises there were two other gentlemen seated in our table"	Date of stay: August 2016
Jamila Y	Poorly maintained and falling apart	The entire hotel is poorly maintained with no sign of much needed renovation.  All the furnitures are falling apart. Even the safe wasn't working. The shower curtains are dirty and the paint is peeling off. Not at all worth the price we paid.	Date of stay: August 2016
vip3855	Will remember the stay	"Very good location and spacious.  Hotel is old but has modern facilities that looks like patch work but functional.  A good renovation may make it more attractive.  Centrally located with all good eating joints like Dutch Hospital (that has many food joints) world trade center and other business activities walking distance.  The food spread in buffet is full of choice Indian, Continental, middle eastern etc.  Pricing is ok.  Good bar, swiming pool, steam and sauna."	Date of stay: August 2016
noxrulz007	"Over priced, Not satisfied not even 3 star."	"Very old and dirt rooms. On inquiry I was told that this hotel was build some 30 years ago and I am damn sure then haven't changed an single thing since then, the lobby of the hotel is very impressive but as soon as you get out of the lift to the floor you regret paying  that much for a hotel."

Shamini Ras R	outdated but average	"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for about 3 nights end-july. We had some problems checking into our previous hotel and we had managed to get galadari by luck and because it was situated near to hilton, where we were supposed to go for a wedding.  Upon arrival at 4 am, we were told that their reservations department would only open at 830 am and that they did not have confirmation of our booking. I guess this  was a fair explanation so my husband and i fell asleep at the lounge till 730 am after which we were allowed to check-in to a room. After that, all went smoothly...check out was smooth.  The location of the hotel is not too bad, it is near Galle face beach and there are many autos/trishaws available outside for you to hop on. This hotel is directly opposite the old"	Date of stay: July 2016

Helen A	A bit past its best	"Large hotel in Colombo near the sea front. We were given a smoking room despite asking for non-smoking. We realised after the smell in the corridor, which wafted under our door, became so bad we had to put a towel under the door. When we complained they promised to move us but the room was not ready when they said it would be and until we asked to see the manager no-one even apologised. However we did eventually get a really good response from the duty manager. One night the double bed was made up with a single sheet leaving a large expanse of bare mattress at the bottom of the bed. Clearly there are staff training issues which need attention! Food was nice and reasonably priced but rooms perhaps over-priced for what they are."	Date of stay: June 2016

Tapan K	Good breakfast & comfortable rooms.	It is a comfortable hotel and we had a pleasant stay. The only thing that was unacceptable was their refusal to call a meter taxi. They insisted that we take the hotel car. And the charges for a  drop to the airport was exactly twice compared to an air conditioned Kangaroo Cab. This is not tin he right spirit because they are running a hotel and not a cab service.	Date of stay: June 2016
snowflakes12	Nice hotel with great view	"The room is nice, comfortable bed and is close to the ocean which is a nice view.  Bathroom comes with bath tub, toiletries, hair dryer, bath towel, face towel and floor mat.  Breakfast is good.  Big lobby and can accommodate many people."	Date of stay: June 2016
Soumyadeep B	"Breakfast buffet is amazing, but rooms are ok."	The hotel Location is perfect and sea facing rooms are recommended. The lobby is good. But once you take the lift and arrive on any floors for you room the feeling is very closed and old. Standard rooms are ok but not worth what they charge. Bed is not that comfortable. The interior is old. But when you talk about the restaurants in Galadari they are superb. Indian lunch thali is just what you would like for lunch worth every penny. The breakfast buffet is grand and lots of option with quality of food. They just need to something on the rooms otherwise its an ideal hotel to stay in Colombo.	Date of stay: June 2016
Jayantika Soni	Good hotel close to ocean	"The hotel was located near the government buildings of Colombo. Quite close to ocean, and dutch hospital. The staff was helpful. They had some keycard problem, it kept on getting deprogrammed and you have to go to reception everytime. I was booked as a part of the conference, they gave me a smoking floor and it was quite horrible sometimes as they have centralized cooling. Rest of the stay was quite good. I enjoyed Colombo."	Date of stay: July 2015
Matt S	Convenient location	"We stayed one night in this hotel due to its proximity to the train station that we needed the next day. The hotel staff were accommodating as we needed to check in at 4am due to our flight arrival time. We were initially impressed by the hotel's decor in the lobby area. However, on entering the room, the decor was far more dated and the room even seemed damp. Perhaps this was due to the monsoon?  Anyway, breakfast in the morning was good. The views to the Indian Ocean near the outdoor pool area were good too.  Overall, a convenient stay for what we needed. The hotel provided a quick taxi to the train station the next day."

Susan	Lovely View!	The view is just amazing from the rooms and the rooms are clean & comfortable too. Room service is pretty efficient and a must mention is that we had left one of our iPhones in one of the coffee tables on the sofa area in the lobby. And when we realized we did and called the reception a few mins later they had it delivered to our room getting info & proof that it was really ours. Which was great! This usually doesn't happen nowadays in the world. Anyways thank you for a pleasant stay. We will be back soon!	Date of stay: March 2016

Nice suprise is Mlesna shop with quite good prices for tea, if you didnt overpaid at the Tea factories."	Date of stay: February 2016
anonymoushotelier	Disappointing!	"This is one of the hotels that belongs to the older vintage of properties on Colombo. The only thing charming about this hotel is its name.   The lobby and public areas all look very old. Infact, the sofa in the restaurant is so tired that you do not feel like sitting on it as you feel it's grease will stick onto your trousers.   The rooms are old and tired with minimal lighting and almost dark at night.   The service is pathetic and the food quiet terrible.   This hotel is an absolute no no!  A disgusting stay overall. I was happy to check out. Good riddance!"	Date of stay: March 2016

The hotel is dated, the staff unfriendly, facilities poor. We were booked out to an executive room on the excutive floor, the shower curtain had black mouldy marks on it, the hairdryer black tape around it and overall the bathroom felt grubby. The view was good and beds comfortable. The reception staff were distracted, unhelpful and unfriendly, very dissapointed. As we were late arriving we ordered room service, we asked for a wine list which they brought up, when I picked a wine, he said I will have to go down and check we have that as we don't have quite a number of the wines on the list! Why then bring the list, let us know"	Date of stay: March 2016

yiannissofia	"Great location, good value for money, could do with a revamp"	"Our hotel room was on a high floor, offered a great view of the Indian Ocean and the furniture were colonial style and the first impression was very good. However, the carpet and bathroom were pretty old and kinda stuffy..on the plus side, breakfast was rich, fresh and tasty, staff was very helfull and the location was very convenient (close to the beach front, dutch hospital etc). There was limited wifi access from the room so we had to pay 7$ extra/day to get proper signal..wifi speed remained slow whatsoever"	Date of stay: February 2016
amitgoenka20	Old luxurious hotel with basic facilities	"Stayed at this hotel in Jan 2016, while on a business travel. The hotel gives the feel of an old luxurious property that requires a makeover. I do not have any major complaints apart from the old feel of the hotel. Overall, the rooms are ok, front staff co-operative and restaurants are fine. Breakfast is standard with few Indian and local options included.  Location of the hotel is decent, near several eateries and teahouses (a must try in Colombo). The hotel is situated right next to the beach at the beginning of the Galle face, which offers a good stroll.  Go for a sea facing room if you want a good view.  However, if you want to live in a more happening area, then select a good hotel on the other end of the Galle face."	Date of stay: January 2016
Muthuraman A	Nice View and lavish breakfast	"Though old, the property still has its charm, nice renovated rooms and excellent view of the city and beach from top floors, I stayed in the 10th floor and the views were awesome. The bathroom amenities were not of 5* standard, but the breakfast was definitely a 5* treat. Excellent varieties, good taste and really lavish spread. The free wifi would work only in the lobby and you need to pay if you want wifi in the room, which for sure isint good in era of technology. Overall it was a nice and pleasant stay. I would rate the hotel as 4* deluxe. Not much of negatives."	Date of stay: February 2016
MatildaSSC	Below 4-Star	"I stayed on the 8th Floor on the nights of Feb 2nd and 3rd. Room was dated and dirty, furniture was worn, curtains need cleaning particularly the sheer curtains which was black on the top and grey in colour all the way down to the floor. This hotel is in need of urgent renovation."	Date of stay: February 2016

TissaSilvalondon	Fabulous Staff. Friendly and welcoming.I call this hotel my second home.	I go to this hotel few times a year and I am being looked after from the car by the smiling door men. Professional Front Office Staff checks you in few minutes. Front office staff are well trained. The lobby managers are very welcoming and hospitable. Restaurants staff are helpful and courteous. They are so helpful you get hungry. Room service and house keeping staff are fantastic. In this hotel there are smiles everywhere. Professional management staff are available at all times if you require. Lobbies are well maintained.clean and shiny. Different restaurants are there for any choice of food.	Date of stay: January 2016
Christopher L	Good and Not so Nice equals Better Than Average	"Good: Very decent location. Views of Galle Face (south side rooms only). Fully functional facilities (sauna, pool, fitness room). Choice of restaurants and Breakfast spread, Pleasant and Responsive staff. Not so nice: Dated rooms, Generally old equipment and furnishings, Basic toiletries, High cost of stay (room price, taxi service, tips) So overall, a better than average experience. Don't really think it's value for money. However, it was heaving with activity when I was there so the hotel could probably say the price is right."	Date of stay: February 2016
Rory James DOYLE	Galadari Hotel	"Pleasant decent functional hotel in a good central location and better value for money then neighbouring Kingsbury or Hilton. Reception / check in can be a bit busy and the room aircon is quite noisy but the in room wifi is good and there are at least 3 restaurants in the hotel. So overall a good value for money, functional hotel stay experience."	Date of stay: February 2016

Shihan S	Excellent High tea with many options	We gathered our evening with my cousins to celebrate our re - union and it was a excellent outing with many food varieties. One thing to improve is the surrounding is bit old though the dining is perfect.  I wish come again with my office team.	Date of stay: January 2016
Sarah A	A journey back in history	"We have spent there two days only for a conference and the place is amazing -l the architecture and the atmosphere - it felt like a journey back 100 years , the restaurants as great - though the food could have more options .. The location is perfect - the beach is on the other side of the street"	Date of stay: January 2016
Sumith G	No Dinner for Guest on 31st Night	"We stayed there 31st night, and there were no tickets for residence to have 31st night dinner. Hotel rooms were too old. Definitely need a good renovation. We were not happy. Breakfast wasn’t bad tho."	Date of stay: December 2015
Nelunherath	High Tea	"The best High Tea I ever had. There was a variety of food items, amazing a sandwhich corner with all sorts of sandwhiches breads, burghers mimi pizzas,vegetarians as well  Then there were indian items as well. there was really an amazing spread so much of food  and drinks as well, hot tea and coffee as well as fresh juices, also a japanese sushi counter  and the sweet counter too had a lot of amazing cakes cookies deserts and sooo much including baked alaska. Well we really had a superb High Tea and we never though of dinner after that. Well I'll be definitely going there again."	Date of stay: December 2015
Prashant	Let Down Hotel	"This hotel is not upto the service required. I got a free upgrade to penthouse. Rooms were big and good. The breakfast had lot of options which was good as well.   Cons : Internet didn't work. I called the hotel staff who asked me to call Internet services provider of their hotel to fix it up. I f had to get it fixed it up twice for which I wasted more than one hour for them over phone.  Staff seemed tired and worked up. Everything you call any hotel personal on the phone it seemed they were put there without their wished and their voice look tired and boring.   Only the bell captain and boy seemed active and did something meaningful and took extra efforts to help me. The lift , the gym, the spa all look worked out and not upto the standards."

C. Rajendrasingh	good hotel by beach side	i stayed here hardly 18 hrs as transit pax on srilankan airlines and i found this hotel is a very luxurious one. service is good and rooms are fine with bath tubs. different restaurants cater different kind of food. wifi is okay. there is a pick up n drop service available both in airport and hotel. should be booked in advance for vehicles. never attempt to take outside taxis or three wheelers as the drivers may approach you for bad motive and suggested to use only the hotel's cars marked as 'galadari'.

778juliette88	would not recommend this hotel to anyone	"Checked in on 31st December 15. check in  process went very well. courteous staff. friendly trainee staff at check in. went to the room waited more than 30 minutes for our luggage to be delivered in the room. requested for an iron, it never arrived. nor did I ever got any feedback if it was coming or not. called housekeeping, they asked me to call laundry department. called, they asked me to call reception. What the heck. already things started to go wrong. the only thing I can congratulate the hotel, is the new year eve dinner. it was amazing.so may options of dishes to choose from. great music band, DJ. well done on this part. the day after fell like the hotel had just changed new management. terrible service at the pool. they have a "" pool bar"" but from what I saw was only"	Date of stay: December 2015
Stephen B	Many good aspects just a few let downs	"There is a lot that is good about this hotel Location is great Rooms very clean and tidy Fresh flowers  But we found the hotel a bit impersonal. Breakfast was fine, a wide range of selections although we definitely had tastier fare elsewhere in Sr Lanka. I must admit I always felt we were slightly ignored at breakfast, had to get a coffee, overworked staff I suspect. We were Also only staying till 8pm on the second night despite paying for the whole night  but we were totally fobbed when asking if we could swap our paid for breakfast for a snack in the cafe."	Date of stay: January 2016
SRAkhtar	House staff are theives	I got my designer Sandals taken from my room. When i checked my baggage when i returned to my country they were gone. They were a gift & really precious because of that. My friend was staying there. She asked the reception to check but they were no help. The bell boy bringing my stuff from the room would have informed me if i had left some stuff behind which was not the case as i checked it before checking out.  Their service is not good. I stayed on 8th floor. Rooms are dirty. The food is okay. If you have to pay this much its better to stay somewhere else.	Date of stay: January 2016
Bachir Z	Convenient Location but?	"Nicely located just next to the ocean. It seems some of the floors are newly redecorated , we were on the 4th which needs some renovation. We stayed during the new year. Food buffet was OK for breakfast and Dinner. Cleanliness in the room could be better. Staff are friendly. and very honest . We were able to recuperate two jackets that we forgot in the room after three days. May be will give it another chance in the future."	Date of stay: December 2015
Amir V	Beware of this Place	Went to spent  X-mas in Colombo. .the hotel is more like -1 Star.. reception counter was like a zoo  and there was only 1 gentleman who was handling the guests and answering the phones. After a wait for more than 1 hour we were shown to our room which was stinking and mould on the walls..etc..I was pretty sure I would come down with some respiratory ailment if I spent a night in the room..upgraded ourselves but it was no better..we finally checked out and went to Cinnamon Grand.Ofcourse the money we had paid for 2 nights was not refunded. ..BEWARE!!!	Date of stay: December 2015
nzvisitor2015	Report card = Room for improvement: must try harder	Staff were nice and helpful.  Hotel was seriously overbooked during new years night.  600 guests+100 places for breakfast= people eating standing+food running out.   Took three days for electrical fault to be repaired.  Finally got a new room when the toilet started to leak. Gym and pool were good Owners- you need to invest some serious money in this hotel.	Date of stay: January 2016
Traveller	Good value hotel with excellent location and service	I have stayed at this property on several occassions. I have always liked to stay here. Located at the heart of the Colombo city with most government offices nereby.  Sea side rooms offer excellent view of the coast. Good service and food. Restaurant has live music at night.

725barbara	Hotel and interior is beautiful	"Only visited the hotel for High Tea to entertain friends. I didn't find it impressive food was dry, waffle making Chef had no customer service. When complained that is the way he is? the waiter fixed the issue and apologise. Also be mindful if you have to take a trishaw walk away from the hotel and holt one from the road, or call for a Kangaroo cab or Nano cab. As there is a trishaw man parked by the side of the entrance of the hotel and does not let other trishaws come in by telling them off, this does not look good for such a beautiful hotel, It was a heavy rain evening and the entrance was swamped with people trying to get out, one Dooman trying to sort everyone, poor fello. Being a hotelier mysel it felt uncomfortable just to watch."	Date of stay: November 2015
martjeniffjer	its beautiful	"the hotel lobby was huge and glorious, the lady attendant assisted us to the rooms, the location of the hotel is good the staff is very charming but communication with them was a problem they could not understand English but very hospitable."	Date of stay: March 2015

Gayan S	Marketing team is impressive	"We were warmly welcome by the galadari marketing team. They did a great job in organizing our cooperate event and very please with the quality of service. Miss.Nishi Rathnayake of marketing department communicated and cooperated well with us in organizing the event, which was a success."	Date of stay: January 2016
sanjivarchna	2 Star services in a 5 Star	It took endless time to check us into our rooms although we were the only ones checking in. The person serving us in the Indian restaurant produced the finger bowls only when requested to do so after the bill was brought . He then brought 4 big bowls for 9 of us . We discovered to our dismay at the airport that the packed breakfast was non-veg despite clear instructions atleast twice for a veg one. Definitely expected better services at a 5 STAR.	Date of stay: December 2015
JeniferAbdulhafeez	Not worth the price	"Where do I start..huh.. definetly not worth the money.. The room was dirty, carpet smeared with stains, not enough lighting. The bath that was once white is now yellow. After cleaning the room roughly, no towels are replaced we always have to call the hosuekeeping and it comes after half an hour..  The pool hs no bar and we ordered some snack that came after one hour and the chicken was still raw. I asked to see the manager and no one came. No mini bar"	Date of stay: January 2016
RobbyThommy	Absolutely rubbish	"We had the misfortune of spending our New Year eve at this place. The rooms are large but carpets are stained, poorly lit, no wifi connectivity in rooms even though they promise you that it is availible. For the gala New year eve dinner we had booked this couple of months in advance thru our travel agent. When we land up at the hotel there is no reservation. Our family of 6 members were finally given a table at the end of the room in a corner. The gala dinner was a disaster. The food served was cold, refilling was slow, and the taste awfull. The next day for breakfast there weren't any service staff nor were there enough tables set up for the guest of the hotel. This reflects on the poor management leadership of the hotel. Would never recommend this hotel."	Date of stay: January 2016
pvijayra	Reasonable place but definitely not 5 Star	Massive and excellent breakfast area. The rooms are basically 3 star quality. The hotel has a number of rules especially towards corkage in their bars and hence is not large group friendly. Apart from that do not leave any valuables in the room. Atleast 6 people in my group lost some money (clever that only part of the money was robbed but not enough to notice and complain). Wifi does not work in certain floors and so you would have to be in the lobby to access wifi.	Date of stay: December 2015
Yohan_Liyanage	Great value for money	Best place in Colombo who provides a good service for a reasonable rate. Café 64 is the most reasonable place you can find to have a good meal for a low price. High tea is very good here plus California grill / Arabic restaurant food is a great value for money. Coffee shop is open 24 hours. Very friendly staff.	Date of stay: January 2016
sheveekaf	Horrible. Not five star	Worse hotel ever. Not a five star. Staff are not welcoming. Stayed I the precidential flour with my family. Horrible service. The one and only hotel who charged us for milk for babies. No other hotel ever charges in the world. Horrible food. Please do not stay here. There are many more lovely hotels in Colombo to stay.

Salay B	disgusting	"i couldn't make out if it was a room or a toilet. They couldn't give us an iron for clothe ironing and there food was unpleasant, the view was average however still not bad in overall i do not recommend this hotel as it is extremely unhygienic and overpriced for the rooms."

Chamath A	Value for Money	"I went recently with my office colleagues for Buffet Lunch. It was priced at LKR 2000 and with the discount it came as LKR 1200 Net. Good variety of food available (Chinese, Indian, Western, Sri Lankan etc). Place was packed so if for Lunch, advisable to book in advance and be there at least by 12 p.m."	Date of stay: December 2015
rakhipriya	The cover is better than the book	"The hotel has great exteriors and amazing ambiance till the reception. Once we entered the room, we found it very average.. May be 3 star something. The view fromt he hotel is great as it faces the sea. Breakfast was again average and more inclined towards southern delicacies like dosa, idli, vada etc. They also had continental options but the spread was not extensive which other hotels of the same stature, offer. They have a gym and pool too. Overall a good experience but has scope for improvement."	Date of stay: February 2015

A T	Excellent Colombo hotel	"This is an excellent hotel for a stay in Colombo. There is a gym (a bit old), pool, steam room and rooftop tennis court. Rooms were clean, although space was a little limited and the bathroom was quite dated. The dinner and breakfast buffets are excellent and there is a wide variety of food available. Staff are very attentive - drinks on arrival and bags carried up to room. The attached bar - Margarita Blue - has music playing and contains a pool table. Would definitely recommend it."	Date of stay: December 2015
Amira E	Good choice for Arab travellers	"This hotel is owned by UAE company thus you will find many arab travellers there. The service is good but not fantstic. It could be overpriced little bit against the service they provide. The breakfast is very good and has a lot of varieties. The location is amazing overlooking the Ocean. The view might be better at the nearby hotel (Kingsbury) but the price there is higher than Galadari. Personally I enjoyed my stay at this hotel for business trip but if I will go to Colombo again for relaxation, I will choose another hotel much closer to the ocean like the ones at Mount Lavina."

borneogeoff	High tea Sri Lankan Style is not to be missed.	"From the moment you step out of your taxi and met by the friendly concierge the service at The Galadari cannot be faulted. We came here for the High Tea which was recommended to us by friends who lived in Colombo. High Tea Sri Lankan style is a feast. Traditional cakes and sandwiches which you would expect but add onto this hot dishes such as curried meats, skewers of beef, chicken and other delicious snacks and you have a meal. The sweet section was above what one would expect with Baked Alska obviously a house speciality. A wide range of Sri Lankan teas to chose from completed a very entertaining afternoon complete with pianist. The service was excellent, discreet but very attentive. The price for the afternoon extremely good value. High tea here is not just a tourist event."	Date of stay: November 2015
Tariqm85	Good Stay	"We stayed for one night only, but everything was good, the room was big and clean, same for the washroom, even the breakfast you can find a lot of option.  WIFI is paid which is so strange, I stayed in four different hotels during my trip in Sri Lanka and this was the only hotel with paid WIFI.  The only thing is that the staff need to be trained on customer service more, I didn't feel that they are friendly like other hotels staff, they just answer your question without giving any other solutions or options.  In future if it was one night I will stay again but for more than that I will look for something else."	Date of stay: December 2015

travler-ceylon	Irresponsible doormen and security staff	"This hotel is so disorganized right from the main entrance - Doormen are turning the back and chatting . Valet parking is not welcome , force the guest to drive to the carpark , humiliated . I called the reception to talk to someone who could assist with information ,first I was transferred to  Banquet who did not know it was a guest or a colleague. Then transferred to security post , he did not know any language and kept the phone - Hotel has got so bad rating that it deserve !"	Date of stay: December 2015

armin201	Good Hotel in need of major overall update	Location with an excellent sea view. But the hotel needs a major overhaul...wifi needs to be paid for...not free..breakfast good...carpets  and plumbing need to be updated and renovated. Staff friendly and helpful. Late checkout was plus point as flights to India are late in the evening. .	Date of stay: November 2015

saunak2014	Good Stop Over Place	"Good for overnight stay ,very conveniently located,very nice view from the rooms.The hotel is old which is apparent from the rooms which needs some facelift.Overall it is comfortable.Not a 5 star hotel but all facilities are available.One has to pay for the Wifi,which is unusual .Food served is above average,nothing great ,but one gets a fairly good choice.The staff are polite , friendly and helpful. Not suitable for long stay."	Date of stay: October 2015
Adil H	Good location and sea views!	"The outside of this hotel looks impressive but the rooms and bathrooms are a little tired.  However, they are large and more than adequate.  The lobby and arrangement of restaurants and the bar are excellent as a very interesting and inviting ambience is created.  The breakfast spread was huge and caters for all pallets.  The choice for dinner was also great and all reasonably priced.  The staff, especially those in the restaurants are very pleasant and friendly.  We had a very enjoyable two nights stay on our way to Bentota beach. The sauna and steam facilities are good to have but need a facelift as they are a bit dingy.  No Spa as such but a massage room was available.  There is a pool but we did not have time to use.  Would certainly recommend as good value for money 4 star"	Date of stay: October 2015
IntlTrainer	Just an average business dinner	My customer reserved this hotel for a business meeting and dinner.  We had about 40 guests. The set up was ok - the technician made sure everything was working.  The problem was the party next door took celebration to a whole other level.  We had to wait until they stopped parading in the hall beating on drums and yelling at the top of their lungs.  The food was just ok for me.  It was a buffet dinner and there was western food with a mingle of Sri Lankan curry and rice dishes.  I wasn't so impressed.    The hotel is located in a nice area near the beach.

KrishI	Worst High Tea EVER!	"I already knew this hotel serves really REALLY bad food but ended up going as a majority of my school mates didnt know how bad the food here was. I actually paid ASSUMING, ok maybe they have approved since I last came here a couple of years ago...  The food was BAD!!! It was so bad, my friends specific words were ' There was nothing tasty' .. The food was bland beyond anything. The options were horrid.  Every single food item we served on our plates was just bad and even ended up remaining the food coz it was just BAD!!   I really dont know how a hotel can serve such bad food. The place however is great for those who have not gone to good hotels.  There was a time Galadari was a good hotel with great food, but clearly times up for them..."	Date of stay: October 2015
Ross_C_1991	Great location in Colombo	"The Galadari is in a great spot in Colombo - you have the Dutch hospital just behind it with one of the best Crab restaurants I've been too and it's right by the sea. Unfortunately, it rained in Sri Lanka whilst I was there for 2 nights but everything about Colombo was serene. The people are really friendly and proud of their country and the nightlife is excellent too, especially with a bar/karaoke night in Margarita Blue inside the hotel. The rooms themselves are clean and well maintained; there is also a gym and pool on the 1st floor which are better than most I've seen in this type of hotel. The staff are really helpful too - fully recommend the Galadari as a place to stay!"	Date of stay: October 2015
Rashidul Karim Khan	Just one night	My stay in Galadari was just a night. The location of the hotel is perfect. Galle Face beach is very near. Behind the hotel there are some restaurants and bars worth visiting. some Room was okay. Furtinures slightly old but it didn't really matter. Bed was comfy which was what I really needed to be.

kathee156	Could be 4 star rated when refurbished	"My review is based on a one night stay prior to touring Sri Lanka. I went on to stay in a further five hotels.  After a long flight I found the hotel welcoming. It's location in Columbo is good - it sits on the sea front opposite parliament buildings and is handy for the city too. The road outside is busy - but that's to be expected in Columbo and the traffic noise did stop in time to allow a good nigh's sleep. The room was dingy but once the hotel is refurbished I'm sure I'd give it 4 stars - the bed was comfortable and the room was clean. Meals were buffet style, varied and catered for all tastes. WiFi is available - but unlike other Sri Lankan hotels there is a charge and it's very costly - check before you use it!! All in all - this is a good hotel though somewhat dated."	Date of stay: September 2015
Dayantha P	Food.	"Coffe shop buffet is terrible and it cost LKR 2500 per person. Food is large scale but no taste. and it is very difficult to dine there because too many managers and supervisors walking by our table without a reason. very disturbing and no peacefulness, i will not recommend for the future people to dine there."

Independent_Joe	This is a pleasant  old colonial style hotel	"It has charm, from its older fittings if slightly shabby. I had an excellent meal here as well as afternoon tea and refreshments. I also attended a conference ... Well organised by efficient and helpful staff.  If I had one issue it was Wifi... Without a room I could not connect, despite discussing with the conference staff and the front desk. I got the feeling they are not yet quite in the modern world at least for people like me on business."	Date of stay: October 2015
sajida018	The High Tea is superb	"The spread is great for high tea.. they were simply delicious. The spacing is also great to have a personal chit chat with friends and family and the price is reasonable too.   The food is halal, didn't find anything that has pork in it. Having a prayer room will be a plus."	Date of stay: December 2014

Rekshere	Had a room with a view :))	We got a room with a wonderful view facing the Galle .. The rooms are old and need renovation but comfortable. The DJ & the band that played in Margerita Blue was excellent and had a wonderful time dancing till wee hours in the morning.. Breakfast spread was good but it remained the same for all the 3 dyas we stayed and hence got a bit repititive and boring.. Had issues with wifi connectivity.. But we were busy exploring colombo that we didnt really mind till the end of the day when you get back to hotel.. The lounge was also good with another good band playing there the second day and they played all the favourite songs..:)) The hotel staff too very very pleasant and warm.	Date of stay: October 2015
Mish786	Great spread for High Tea	"Enjoyed a family gathering on a Wednesday afternoon and was worth a visit. Good choice of savouries and sweets although it was missing eclairs, crasonnants and tarts.  Having a prayer room is a plus too at this luxury venue."	Date of stay: October 2015
Sujeewa W	Excellent Service & Plce for Fine Dine	"Went to Galadari for a business forum . Used one of their conference rooms . Very good Hotel indeed, Service is excellent, Staff is very polite and customer friendly. Used their coffee shop for dinning .

From different flavors of curd to puddings , fruits etc."	Date of stay: September 2015

Booked in advance for three bed room, but when we turned to reception we were told that three bed room is not available and we have to settle with an extra bed in one double room. Room given was good in size.  The extra bed given was not fit for an adult with height of 5.11. we have call the housekeeping for a blanket too which was not there with extra bed Two queen size bed were good in size.

trolleydolly2015	Vert tired	"This is one of two hotels that we stayed at in Colombo.  The Galadari although rated as Luxury is very 'tired and over due refurbishment which I believe I believe is about to happen.  Our room had old orange patterned carpet and generally was tatty.  There is a small cost for wi fi and small things like room service ice.  Some buttons on the lift do not illuminate, there is a general impression of; well we are about to renovate so we won't bother fixing things.  On the positive side,  The pool is great, a good length for doing laps and really deep.  The gym is quite good for an older hotel with enough equipment to get by with and both the buffet breakfast and dinner was fabulous, that coming from someone who is VERY particular about good food."

Rachael  R	Tired Room and Bad Food	"We booked the Galadari at the last minute for our final night in Sri Lanka. The lobby and service at check in made a nice impression, no complaints there. However, the room was quite shabby and some of the light fixtures did not work. The carpet was worn and questionable as to cleanliness. The bathroom needed serious updating, including a new/clean shower curtain. On the positive side....the city view from the room was spectacular. A nice final view of Sri Lanka. We ordered room service, which arrived promptly, but the food was terrible.  Our flight left at 3am so we had booked the room as a place to relax before a long flight. The room served it's purpose but I am glad we were not staying the whole night."	Date of stay: September 2015
TissaSilvalondon	Excellent Hotel	I have been going to this hotel for the last 20 years. I go to this hotel at least three times a year and some years may be more. Welcome begins from the entrance with the doormen from there onwards there are welcomes from every memeber of the satff. You will see smiles where ever you turn and I must say that every member of staff are very helpful and courteous. In general you can not go wrong with this hotel. I call it my second home.

Shadi B	Not recommended for tourists	"If you are a tourist you don't want to be in this hotel , the hotel rooms are very old , the hotel interior and decor are very old , the breakfast is very bad , a small room  full of locals that sit one close to another and keep staring of you are a girl or in a company of a girl ."

Sarfaraz K	"Satisfactory, although it can be better"	"Used to be the underdog in comparison to Hilton, right next door, however after Hilton loses its quality, Galadari, had stepped it up a bit. Should invest into the quality and modernity of the the restaurant."	Date of stay: September 2015

AnoopNaroor	Needs renovation	"The hotel is old and the rooms are not nice. For the price you pay, it is definitely not worth it. There are many other better options around. This hotel is around 30 years old and needs renovation. The only good thing about the hotel is that the food was nice."	Date of stay: September 2015

Sunil Unni	Business visit	"Stayed at this hotel for one night, one a business trip on a sea view room. The hotel found heavily overpriced for the quality of services it is providing.  Room furniture's found old and poorly maintained.  The reception staff does not appear courteous."	Date of stay: September 2015
Edward L	Magnificant view from the window	"Stayed here for 4 days when travelling, this place is in Colombo 1, which means the very center of Colombo, back to back to the World Trade Centre, and next to Hilton Hotel, it would be very convenient going anywhere in the city, not to mention Colombo Fort Railway station is at walking distance.  Since the hotel is just next to the coastline, if your room is facing the sea, you will find magnificant view from the window.  Now this hotel is also serving many tourists which you will see in the breakfast, by the way, the breakfast they offer is just fine."	Date of stay: June 2015
shripad52	Not tourist friendly	This hotel is essentially a bussiness hotel. We went for  a dinner to their Restaurant and were rudely turned back as it had a dress code. But this was not mentioned anywhere  not even on their room TV channel.I felt humiliated in front of my family . I brought it to the notice of the staff there. If the hotel wants tourist also they should make their rules very clear at the time of check in.	Date of stay: September 2015
Mathew G	"Wonderful service , Superb hotel"	Ideal for business and official events. Food is great and friendliness of the staff is great and very helpful. The hotel cleanliness is very good and very fresh with the sea breeze. Rates are quite resonable and the locarion is quite convenient. Many sceneries from this hotel like the twin towers and other sites coming up soon.	Date of stay: September 2015
IanD64	"The staff are 5 star, the hotel is not. An overpriced disgrace"	"3 days without hot water, broken power-points, dead lightbulbs, lost laundry. Unauthorised charging to my credit card, because they hadn't read the emails from my hosts, lift buttons that sometimes worked, and all of this at 5 star prices."	Date of stay: September 2015
dirtbikerjag	Visit to Sri lanka	I will never go here and the staff was very good but its a 30 some year old hotel with old furniture and smells old too. Bath tub didn't drain and we checked out the next day.  Food was ok for over $120 we went to Cinnamon Red and had a good time.  My advise is don't go here as there are many other hotels that are very comfortable.	Date of stay: September 2015
Paul S	Excellent Afternoon tea service	"The high tea service is very good value for money as well as a pleasure to partake as long as one is hungry. A wide variety of eastern and western choices including scrumptious sandwiches, cakes and flavourful Sri Lankan Tea."	Date of stay: June 2015

afzal8549	good hotel in srilanka	"hotel is very good with sea facing room, room size are quite large as compare to normal room size hotel is equipped with restaurant where morning breakfast is complementary. Food choice is good during dinner if you take buffet included in your room price for that you have to book hotel through agent or service providers (online)"	Date of stay: August 2015
Andrew A	Not a Hotel if you are traveling with Family	The Hotel needs lots of updates. Staffs are friendly. This is not a hotel to go and stay with family. Majority of hotel guest are business men. the food was ok but if you really want to eat Sri Lankan food around this hotel area then i would walk over to Hilton.	Date of stay: October 2014
janakiP	Vibrant with great service	"Located in the heart of Colombo with a fantastic view of the Business District and sea. We were there for the new year's and the hotel was vibrant, brightly lit and bustling with activity and people from all over the world.  The breakfast buffet is fantastic, although dinner and lunch have few options for vegetarians. Great rooms - spacious and well serviced.  All in all made for a very pleasant experience."

Srirambalaji S	Excellent hotel at reasonable cost	"The hotel seemed a bit dated but clean and friendly. You can walk on the promenade by the beach 1 minute from hotel and is busy and safe. Food and service in the hotel was excellent, only downside was you had to pay for Wi-fi. Nothing was too much trouble. Food was very good and the restaurants were excellent and reasonably priced. Would happily return there if I ever do back to Srilanka."	Date of stay: August 2015
Peter B	Family tour of Sr Lanka	"We arrived on the overnight flight from UK and went to the hotel in the early afternoon. Excellent service from all staff, swimming pool on 1st floor has good views and is private. You can walk on the promenade by the beach 1 minute from hotel and is busy and safe.

RonJmn	Very comfortable hotel in Sri Lanka	"We were at the Galadari for a conference and stayed a few extra days so we could explore Sri Lanka. We had a nice upper floor room facing the old parliament buildings. The warning sticker on the window about taking pictures of government facilities was a little strange. The staff was excellent and always helpful. Breakfast and dinner were included in our room rate and we enjoyed the wide variety of food that was offered, glad to have the continental option as I'm not that used to the spicy food. The hotel seemed a bit dated but clean and friendly."	Date of stay: July 2015

Food was very good and the restaurants were excellent and reasonably priced. Would happily return there if I ever do back to Sri Lanka	Date of stay: September 2014
Derek S	Lovely buffet spread	Had lunch and was quite impressed with the variety on offer at the buffet. Service needs a bit of improvement thought as it comes across as an average bistro where attention to details is lacking (one has to constantly ask for things to the waiters). Had the chance to visit a room which has past its time (despite them boasting about the size - they need a complete refurbishment as they are old and date back to the 70s/80s...	Date of stay: August 2015
Rama M	Average!	"This place is OK for a weekend stay. The food at the restaurant was not up to the mark and I'm not new to Srilankan cuisine. They have a  High Tea buffet at late afternoon, which was good compared to the breakfast buffet."	Date of stay: January 2015
clairer1965	Hotel review	"Had one here before I went travelling, very nice hotel, very clean and tidy hotel, lots of amenities, English plugs, brilliant food and breakfast was excellent , the hotel,staff were amazing and very polite and generous , would highly recommend this hotel and Sri Lanker in general xxx"	Date of stay: August 2015
BBB-MLJ	Ok but very average	I ended up here because of a broken down Emirates plane and an unexpected emergency diversion to Colombo. The hotel seemed a very long (and sometimes hair raising) drive from the airport. The Lobby is nice and it looks like it was once the height of luxury - a few decades ago. Staff were friendly and the breakfast was superb. The room was shabby at best with a need for an immediate update to bring it into the 2000's. No wifi was a hassle for a stranded passenger who didn't expect to be in Sri Lanka let alone this hotel. I think this hotel would be okay for the budget conscious traveler - except I don't know what it cost!! (Emirates paid for me).	Date of stay: June 2015
Shalbin J	"may not be a good place, unless you have no other choices"	"Rooms were small and furniture's fully outdated.. its a quite old building and all the fittings are  really old.. you can really see the old luxury hotel setup here.. no wifi on our floor or rooms...this hotel really needs immediate refurbishment  Good  Location,  very good lobby area food was also good.. however i wont recommend this to any tourist as we are going there for enjoyment..  Never again... unless there are no other choices.."	Date of stay: August 2015
A M	Good hotel but expensive	"It's a very good hotel esp for families, business trips or arab visitors. Nice location, Ocean view but the rooms right the elevator are the best. Nice and helpful staff. Great breakfast open buffet where all what you can imagine is offered. It's very close to the famous market Petah as well as being close to the famous Red Mosque. You can enjoy walking beside the ocean to Galle face or find easily public transportation to wherever you want to go. The only bad thing is being too expensive concerning the service provided."	Date of stay: August 2015
Sajidlak	Outdated!	"Rooms were shabby, furniture fully depreciated with no wifi on our floor. Needs immediate refurbishment and repairs. Location, lobby area and views are the only solace. Very old and worn out property. Kids also felt miserable. Won't stay again."	Date of stay: July 2015
Jan M	Excellent location but dated	The hotel is in an excellent location though when we stayed the Dutch quarter was closed and we struggled to find anywhere to eat. The lobby of the hotel had been updated but the rooms were horrible and in need of a refurbishment. They felt dirty and defiantly smelled of tobacco. The bed was large but horrid hard blankets. The bath was old and rather than white wasdirty white from years of use and I wouldn't want to use it.  I had a shower which was fine.	Date of stay: July 2015
Mushi M	"'Skip, You will have better places for this price for sure.'"	"Reception weren't particulary welcoming, Extremely low value for money, room comfort, very old furniture, unclean, carpets and sheets. everything is need refurbishment. very old hotel interious. pricing more on location less on room.  location is good."

maverickmelbourne	seriously outdated rooms	"the location, staff and the lobby of the hotel is ok but the rooms are terribly outdated. We were on the 5th floor and had what was called a superior room. Upon initial entry itself the room had a bad smell; kinda like everything in there (carpets, curtains, etc) were damp. I couldnt handle it and tried opening the windows for some fresh air but that didnt work either (windows are locked in place and cannot be opened). We asked for an upgrade but since we came as part of a group booking it was a complicated process so we let it go.  Incredibly, in all the hotels i've stayed over years all over the world, this was the first time that I found a hotel without WIFI. Yep, you heard it here. They just dont have it. I was willing to pay for its use but there's no wifi in rooms. Full"	Date of stay: July 2015
Rajesh K	Excellent location	I had stayed in this hotel during a business trip. Hotel's location is excellent with sea at walking distance. Staff was quite friendly and courteous. There are lot of hang out places around and nice walk on seashore line in the night.	Date of stay: January 2015
Hennings1974	Mr	Not value for money.The rooms and pool area is horrible.Dirty and not maintained for many years.Smells like tobacco in the rooms.Wall to wall carpet in the rooms that are at least 25 years old... The reception and resturant area is better. The staff is exelent.	Date of stay: July 2015
Nardeen S	An excellent business Hotel	"My husband and I stayed at Galadari Hotel for one night and it was pretty good. The hotel is located in a strategic place, just at the heart of the business district in Colombo, and just in front of the Indian Ocean.   Our room on the tenth floor was clean and had a lovely sea view. at night we enjoyed a swim on the roof top.  However the creme de la creme, were the breakfast and dinner buffet! they were AMAZINGGGG!!! best buffet I've ever seen: more than 15 main dishes, 6 types of salads, all kinds of sweets and bread... it was just perfect.  Tips on how to get around: the market is just 15 mins away, you can take a tuk-tuk, but make sure you bargain first. behind the hotel to the right along the sea side there's a small light house and a big Buddha temple that you may visit."

Piümî	Excellent Few hours	"for a busy weekend,we chechked in to Galdari,One of the nicest City hotel in Sri Lanka as a day use room.We were welcomed nicely and treated well.Denom in reception took care of us and led us to room.We checked into well standard two rooms and the service is amazing.Everything was provided and we enjoyed the stay.Check out took sometime,but still we were educated regarding same.I hope my team enjoyed lot.Thanks a lot for your fullest support."

LostEarthling	A nice place to stay for business	On business trips to Colombo I always stay at this hotel. Located next to the beach walkway and jogging track and near a few good restaurants is pretty convenient. The gym is good as well and can be handy on rainy days. Prices are reasonable. Don't forget to ask for Internet to be included while booking otherwise extra payment will be needed.	Date of stay: February 2015
2Goodies	Needs some TLC	"This place was clearly once a great hotel - location is fantastic, the lobby lulls you into a sense of luxury, and the rooms are a step back in time. Musty and tired come to mind. Functional and reasonably quiet. Glad we only had one night. The buffet meals were reasonable, selection ok, but just not quite there. Staff lovely."	Date of stay: July 2015
Amica R	Bad....	"We stayed here for one night. The hotel lobby is grand with marble floors and wood paneling. However, the minute we stepped out of the lift on the 5th floor the distinct smell of old carpet hits you in the face. the rooms smell a bit better. Old furniture in the rooms, decent beds, shower could use some work.  No WiFi! And its quite unreasonable to purchase too.  We used the business center which cost Rs 350 for half hour.  The only good thing about this hotel is the food and staff at the restaurant downstairs. Expansive buffet for lunch and dinner., Friendly and helpful staff. But would not come back to stay at this hotel."	Date of stay: July 2015
Ashvinsrating	Great location .. Affordable luxury	I was here with my friends in March 2015  The hotel is centrally located.

Redwan F	"Standard living, not up to the mark of 5 star"	"Went there to attend for IEEE R10 Congress. Had a wonderful time. The hotel lobby and different restaurants were good, though only tested indian and arabic. The ball room was good. The room service was bad, it wasnt regular. Washroom toiletries werent provided regularly. Daily newspaper was only for selected rooms, which wasnt expected for a five star hotel. Pool facilities had a great experience and had a nice view for the mighty see! A great place for photoshoot indeed.  The hotelside shops were really poor in standard. Please note that, regular and famous shoppimg complex are a bit far ftom the hotel, sometimes not of walking distance. Taxi facilities are available in the hotel end.  In one word, its a standard place of short and small visit to colombo. But, you wont get real"	Date of stay: July 2015
Aanaarden	Live Band Saturday night	"I recently visited Colombo and one night we were at Galadari. It was Saturday night and there was a rock band playing that night.

Mohammed Ali A	Disappointing!! Stay only if you are comfortable with much less than mediocrity!	"I traveled to Colombo in May 2015 for business. What a disappointment in this so-called 5 star hotel!! Except for the reasonable location right at the sea front, there is really nothing positive about this hotel. The entire property is in dire need to renovation. The rooms are very ordinary, the furniture is cheap, the carpets are worn out and the washrooms are nothing to talk about. Breakfast is fairly standard, nothing stands out. The entire experience somehow doesn't make you feel at home, unlike many other hotels/hotel chains, which have a warm welcoming feeling. I was on the executive floor and had access to the executive lounge. I decided to go the lounge in evening but what greeted me was a empty big room with lights switched off and no sign of life! On inquiry I was told"	Date of stay: May 2015
Mgkappan	"Great location and views, good rooms and service"	"As a regular visitor to Colombo, I have tried many hotels, but this is my favorite and was going to book the same for my trip next week and saw some really bad reviews here and felt that I have to make a comment. In my several stays at the hotel, I haven't come across any unhygienic, unclean or horrible rooms or circumstances. The staff were always polite and service minded. The comments about wifi is right. They charge for it and even when its included in your tariff, you have to buy it and sometimes this and charge for the breakfast creeps into the bill and I have seen people getting worked up at the reception over these. In my experience, all it takes is just telling them that its part of the plan and they will remove the charges without any issues. I found the breakfast"	Date of stay: June 2015
AjayBalram	"Definitely not a Five Star - Unclean, Unhygienic Rooms"	"Rooms in this so called 5 Star hotel definitely need a complete overhaul and facelift. Travelling with my entire family - Unclean & Unhygienic bathrooms were the last thing we expected after 5 hours on road from Bentota. We tried changing the rooms, searching for a neat and clean one but ALAS they had none. Even their so called ""Presidential Suite"" is a disgrace. To Top it all, they actually charge a bomb for Wi-Fi facility !! Oh Man what era is this Hotel's Management living in ??  Had to regret that I overlooked this hotel's reviews on this site and went ahead trusting my Travel Agent. Well finally we just Check-In and forced our Travel Agent to offer us a stay at OZO Colombo."	Date of stay: June 2015
Nidhi L	Horrible	"The most pathetic choice ever made, for stay. It is not at all a hotel of the current time. Its wall-to-wall carpeted, and coz of trapped humidity the rooms stink badly. Not a very good choice for people with allergy problems. Bathroom knob was broken. Food was bad.had a scary experience of hotel staff trying to forcibly enter room for turn down services, even after i had refused. Sad stay. Happy moments were when i was out of the hotel."

Anil P	Absolutely Horrible Experience	This hotel should have their ratings redone.  Anyone that says the amenities of this hotel are great has obviously not stayed in much decent hotels.  Our experience for the group of 4 rooms was horrible.  The food was mediocre at its best.  The rooms were all smoky and musty.  Carpet was from the 1970s.  Wallpaper was peeling.   That even for their executive lounge floor which goes to show that nothing in this hotel has been updated in 30 years.  Bathrooms had mold and very little ventilation.    WiFi charges for one device per room and it was $7 USD.  That too it does not work in the restaurant our their ballroom area or again on their ground floor except the lobby.  Step outside and you lose your wifi.  From the outside it looks decent. From above the first floor I would not	Date of stay: June 2015

Sarah B	More like a 2 star hotel	"This hotel is a joke for how expensive it is. Everything is very dated, which was confirmed when I spoke to a manager who told me nothing in the hotel had been changed in thirty years. The breakfast and dinner buffet was average. A lot of choice but none of it was particularly good. The reception staff were rude to us and very unhelpful when we arrived. Our room was not very nice, the beds were uncomfortable and the seating area was more like garden furniture. They charge for wifi which I think is absolutely ridiculous. I've stayed in hotels all over Sri Lanka, some as cheap as $15 and everyone has offered free wifi. The hallways smelt of smoke. The location is good, very close to the sea and in walking distance of Colombo Fort Railway Station. Overall it was very disappointing."	Date of stay: June 2015
SKY T	High Tea Time	"Hotel Galadari is an awesome place to stay and the food was fantastic. Staff were so nice and really helpful. I recommend this hotel for anyone who likes to have some relaxing time with your family, then this is one of a good place. Look forward to go back again."	Date of stay: January 2015
Natalie Q	Lovely high tea for the family!	"We've brought family as a treat to the Galadari on two occasions now and always enjoy it! Paid a little extra the first time for a birthday cake and the staff were very accommodating. Tasty selection of savoury foods, pancake and hot food stations, cakes and drinks (better than most in Colombo) at a reasonable price and buffet style always suits our family!"	Date of stay: June 2015
David L	Not value for money	"This hotel is over priced and dated. There are better options nearby in terms of the interior and facilities.  I stayed one night at a cost of about 170 USD including breakfast. An additional charge is applied for WIFI.   The hotel looks fantastic as you walk in but unfortunately the rooms are dated and shabby looking. On a positive note the views onto the bay are excellent.  The gym is very disappointing because of old equipment. In addition WIFI doesn't work in the gym which is very annoying when you pay extra for it.   The staff are friendly and the location is good for accessing the highway to the airport.   Overall, a pleasant enough place but the price is difficult to swallow for a hotel which is crying out for a major facelift."	Date of stay: June 2015
Praj16	Excellent stay	"Visited 2014 October,  Check in was long, Rooms are excellent but too much of security systems involved, i understand its to protect the property Dining - Although many options were available, but i didn't enjoyed taste, had to settle with one or two items and continued with same over 3 day stay Area around - a long walk along the beach is available just 100m away, and wind there was lovely  Overall - could have been better considering the star rating of property"	Date of stay: October 2014
Chris	Good food and ok place	Had my wedding at galadari last year and spent two nights at the hotel. The hotel is a little old and requires a renovation. But the assurance we received during the wedding is second to none. Staff were very helpful. The food was excellent. Would recommend the place for a few nights of you are visiting colombo.

Shilpa G	Nice experinece	"Its a great hotel in a great environment. Food was nice and the service staff was also great. but the highest recommendation will be for their range of beverages. The rooms are neat well maintained and the facilities are above average.  All in all its a hotel that's worth visiting again. Also to mention that the beach is just in the walking distance form the hotel so even for long term visitors, the stay is made even more fabulous by the beach and eye catching sceneries."

Rooms are well decorated with great view, staff is courteous, and excellent spread at Breakfast as well as dinner.   Location is good and you can get around easily.

feroza123	friendly neighbourhood	"I am a frequent visitor to this hotel as I work next door.  This is a people friendly hotel and somewhat home like atmosphere for me as I tend t drop in very often.  I would highly recommend their high tea, which is reasonably priced and also serves a wide variety of delicious food stuff including many live stations.  But I love their iced coffee and the flavoured ice cream available at Cafe 64.  The Hawker Street Cafe 64 dinner too is lovely.  Every night they have it in the outside area with each table lit up with a lantern and the breeze from the sea whipping into you, the feeling is lovely and there is a beautiful ambience to the setting.  There are many varieties of food to select from and the live stations provide it fresh and delicious.  They also have a crab station."	Date of stay: May 2015
ML84	Nice hotel...awesome location	We stayed at the Galadari on the last leg of our trip. The hotel has a vintage charm to it. Its not modern and chique like the Cinnamon but unique in its own way.  Check-in and check out was a breeze. Love the view from our room. It was NYE when we stayed there and it was just lively and perfect.  The hotel location is perfect and we tried out a few restaurants and the food was Superb. Try the Indian restaurant great food and the California Grill is a must visit.  Will certainly recommend this hotel but it isn't 5 star its a good 4-4.5 star.	Date of stay: December 2014

Highly recommend"	Date of stay: May 2015
Arthur S	"Grand lobby, great staff, tired rooms"	"The Galadari certainly knows how to hire and train staff. Every employee we met was outstanding. The restaurants offered very good food and brilliantly efficient and courteous wait staff. The huge weakness is the rooms.  The room we stayed in on the 9th floor had not been renovated in 25 years. The furniture was spare and tired. I would have perhaps put the couch on a sun porch. The bathroom desperately needed upgrading. No one had ever cleaned under the soap dishes in the bathtub (you can see them while lying in the tub, but not while standing in the shower). The tub was cracked, the toilet tank needed cleaning. I suppose that management never tour the rooms and no one complains.  I strongly suggest that the owners go to the rooms and look for themselves. They might also lie in"	Date of stay: May 2015

ZenVentures	Not exciting..  No value for money..	4 of us stayed in this hotel this may in two rooms... We paid close to 10000 INR for each room..  We got good sea facing rooms.. Rooms were decent sized and bathrooms were pretty small..  wifi was giving trouble all the time and they ask you to call the service provider and fix the same..  It was painful..  We stayed there on a sunday and it was lifeless..  We got to their blue margarita bar around 9.00 p.m. and not a soul there..  They didn't want to put on the music also and were keen to get us out than serving liquor..  We moved to the lounge bar and the cocktails were very average..

Aditya K	Deceptive looks.....watch out!	"Impressive.....i thought.My first glance at the hotel location and facade and i said...,impressive. Located on the Galle-face Beach and a stone's-throw away from the city centre the property offers an amazing view of the beautiful Sri Lankan Coastline. I just can say for sure that you will never go wrong with the location of this one. Step inside and your are drawn by the old world looks of the front office. The greetings were good and and though the overall feel was a bit of a let down (read old) I was certain the sea facing room that I was booked into, would override all else. Sea facing it was but run down....and how! This room looked like it was from the seventies (which it incidentally is) and somehow the hotel management has made sure it looks the same.

jndshr	Not bad for the price..	This hotel is old and a little dated in terms of its interiors. But the restaurants are great. If you are looking for 'Halal' food..this is the best place to go to. The view from the rooms is breathtaking of course from the sea facing rooms. The service is not bad either. The hotel is OK..and can get better...its just due for renovation. I wouldnt highly recommend but at the same time wouldn't run it down either.	Date of stay: October 2014

Luxshumyraj S	Poor Infrastructure	"We had our company award ceremony at the Bougainvillea Room, The event started and within 30 minutes the AC's went off , We had a terrible night and all the employees started sweating and this was the end , IT was supposed to be a very active night with people enjoying their achievements , Thanks to galadari Hotel it was spoiled , We got to know from the staff that this was not an exceptional case and this was occurring very frequently , So that means the hotel management has allowed us to book this hotel knowing the Air condition problem, Very Sad that a hotel of this nature is doing such things , Please avoid this hotel for any functions and even for any others as the staff were helpless , They couldn't even provide coolers for the event , Terrible hotel and terrible service ,"	Date of stay: April 2015
manu3939	Nice Hotel but needs renovation	We stayed in Galadari for one night and were extremely happy with the location of the hotel. Its located opposite their old parliament house and opposite beach to the other side.  The hotel's lobby is nice and offers u a good no of restaurants to choose from. The pool is also good.  The rooms need improvements as they are very old and renovation is required.	Date of stay: March 2015
souhardan	GALADARI ASSURES SATISFACTION TO AN AVERAGE TOURIST	"Around 30 minutes drive from Bandara Naike International Airport by a well maintained Highway, you are in front of Galadari. The location of the hotel is a feast for the eyes. On one side lies the Indian Ocean in it's full splendour. The old Parliament Building reminding one, of  the British Colonial days is situated in front of Galadari, just across the road which is indeed a magnificent piece of architecture, maintained perfectly.  The mammoth twin towers behind Galadari add more value to it's aesthetic look.  The check in process was smooth; thanks to the front desk employees. Our room was on the 8th floor facing the sea and a highway, in between. Watching the sea and the ever moving traffic, especially after the sunset was very soothing. It is an old hotel; but, they strive"	Date of stay: April 2015

Abdul Aziz K	Great Hotel !!!	A great hotel with the view of the Indian Ocean if you booked a room facing them. Staffs are friendly and attentive to your needs. Hotel's Breakfast is a luxury which provides you with enough varieties of Sri Lankan and Western food. However WIFI is not free.	Date of stay: April 2015
Bositha F	Best Experience Ever	Visiting this place regularly from my childhood and being able and lucky to work in it for me is an big achievement. Totally friendly staff & beautiful views all around and throughout the hotel. Excellent dishes and a variety of specialized restaurants make Galadari a must to stay and enjoy your vacation or business purposes	Date of stay: April 2015
Sridhar R	Decent Hotel to stay for a business visit	"Galadari is very ideally located and has a very decent standard of accommodation. It might not be the most luxurious hotel in town or has the best of restaurants to boast off. It is most suited for a business traveler or a transit tourist who wants to avoid the traffic in the city. This hotel has a easy get away from city and also has a great view of the sea from the rooms. The hotel staff are very friendly and always are willing to help out in case of any query. I am surprised to see the negative feedback on staff in some of the reviews. I have stayed in the hotel on four occasions in the last 5 months and never had any reason to complain on the staff. Even on a off day when their Dinner buffet lacked variety in vegetarian food, the staff quickly arranged for 3 vegetarian"	Date of stay: March 2015
SZavahir	Dismal customer service and not 4-5 star worthy	"I stayed the night because it was my brother's wedding reception, but I was totally underwhelmed.  Firstly, the service was dismal. First we were told that we would have a room for getting ready. Then we were told that the room for getting ready was the same room where the bride and groom would sleep. Then we were told that we had to pay for the room to get ready as they would finalise a room for the bride and groom. Then while the reception was going on, we were asked to immediately check out of the rooms, because a new room was allocated to the bride and groom. This caused us much inconvenience as we had to leave the function, pack all the wedding parties posessions, pack the groom and brides possessions and hang out at the check in desk while this was sorted. It left a bad"	Date of stay: December 2014
Priyantha G	Gory galadari	I was there for a conference buffet   lunch and the food couldn't be worse even in a Muslim hotel in pettah.That bad. Only the salads were edible. Even the fried rice was so bland that you wondered whether the chefs were on strike and the security team took over. I simply lost my appetite and sought refuge in dessert but alas they were equally bad. The staff could not be less motivated. Even the bell boys seem to believe that they are doing us a favour. The attitudes are utterly atrocious. I asked for the WiFi password and this brat had the nerve to ask for my phone for him to do it.And the WiFi was unbelievably and unbearably useless. In fact I was there for our uni batch anniversary and had a similar treat and I thought it was one of those  rare bad days.But now it's confirmed	Date of stay: March 2015
Vikasdeed	Not Worth it	Hotel is not at all up to the mark. Not a perfect choice if u r spending for a 5 star property.   Room which was alloted to me was ok types but bathroom was very conjusted. No feeling of a 5 star property.	Date of stay: March 2015
Sharmini R	The High Tea	"The High Tea at the Galadari is very satisfying. In the pleasant ambience of the elevated lobby area and sitting area near the Bar, you can sit and munch on delicasies from a variety of sandwiches and savouries plus some Sushi or whatever is on the International range available for the day. Spring Rolls, fried in front of you, kebabs, whatever.... A range of delicious cakes, waffles and pancakes topped up with traditional tea, flavoured teas, coffee, Iced Coffee or Fruit Punch. Undoubtedly the best High Tea in Colombo. A Popular venue for meet ups and birthday celebrations. It is advisable to make a reservation in advance if you are going with a group of friends or family. From 3.30 p.m. to 6.p.m daily. Here's a personal tip ! I go sans lunch ! The Piano player is also good -"	Date of stay: February 2015

ClarkaTravels	"Good food, but old rooms"	"We had to stay here, because our flight was cancelled, so the airline took us to this hotel. First we were impressed, because the location is quite good (right by the ocean and a 5-minute walk from the Fort Railway Station) and the interior looked very nice. But once we got to our room, it was quite a disappointment. This hotel needs renovation really badly. At least everything was clean. Also - there is no wi-fi, only cable and you'll have to pay for this connection.  What we really liked was the food - their buffet (dinner & breakfast) was very good with so many choices, that you could not decided what to get first. We enjoyed the starters, pasta and waffles in the morning."	Date of stay: February 2015
Ihthisham Mubarak	Cake for mum in law	Don't even waste your time here. This hotel does not care for customers or service. All I wanted was a cake . I was referred to by a friend. Very disappointed to see there was only two cake at 2 pm and I was told I need to order 48hrs before. Had to wait think the employees thought I was invisible. I'd rather bake my own cake	Date of stay: February 2015
Paul S	Great place in need of a little TLC to become greater	"After a tortuous 36 hour journey time it was wonderful to be greeted by warmth and a genuine welcome from the hotel staff. Even though my stay was just for 2 days the friendliness and willingness to go the extra mile to please made up for the fact that the hotel fabric needs some TLC.  The facilities are clean and a dedicated housekeeping crew keep the rooms serviced twice per day.The breakfast is something to look forward to and if self indulgance is not controlled,the only recourse is to head straight back to bed.  The views of the Ocean framed by spectacular sunrises and the historical old parliament building provides its own touch of class whilst its central location is a boon for those who need to pack in as many city sights in the shortest time.  As for the bar that's"	Date of stay: February 2015

BADALA A	Was it a Business Class Hotel ???	Just got shocked after seeing beautiful but congested  reception area when actually went into the room (I just can not ignore just as It was on my favorite floor no 7) as both bed quality and interiors were very ordinary.Service quality was very poor and one does need to call two to three times for basic amenities as bathing support or even tea fillers.

Georg V	Galadari Colomba	This run down place looks like an old lady with not enough make up to cover all the cracks.It needs a total make over from carpets to ceilings. You also get the feeling that  they want to take you for every cent possible charging for ice delivered to your room and the Wi-Fi cost you more for a hour than for a week at home. i believe the only positive thing about the place is that the staff is friendly and helpful. There are several other leading hotels in the same area and i certanly can not think of any reason i would return there'	Date of stay: February 2015
cpjain77	Luxury and beach side scenic hotel	I was fortunate to stay at the hotel as part of our accommodation for the management offsite while at Standard Chartered in the month of December. The hotel is just opposite the national parliament house and beside the sprawling Indian Ocean. The food at the hotel is more of sea food kinds and if you are a vegetarian you are bound to struggle. The spread of the desserts and the breakfast variety is quite good though. The rooms are pretty neat and clean and I was lucky to get one of the best view of the ocean and parliament from my room. There is a helipad in front of the hotel and you could see helicopters frequently taking off from the place. There is a guard of honour on the beach every evening and morning where the national flag is hoisted. The hotel has a very nice roof top	Date of stay: December 2014
rpunwani	Hotel need to be refurbished	"Stayed in the Galadari for 3 nights. Co-incidentally, I stayed here in October 1997 when the hotel suffered a bomb attack by the LTTE.  We had to spend a while to have free internet, though the breakfast was included in our package. The stay was comfortable, though the hotel is showing signs of being outdated. There are newer hotels offering better facilities at a lower price than the Galadari. The food in room service is just average. The housekeeping & maintenance could be more efficient. The staff are polite & courteous and the location of the hotel is amazing."	Date of stay: February 2015
imtiaz issadeen	Great service but needs updating	"We have stayed here a few times over the past 5 years.  The hotel is showing its age and there is a lot of work that needs to be done  Security is lax, very lax.   A few annoyances were that the room door would not close automatically, you need to close it shut yourself. The shower needs a replacement of seals as it leaks all over the bathroom floor. The amenities set does not have any toothbrushes nor Conditioner. The exhaust filter in the shower was full of dust and would not exhaust the steam speedily.   The lift has no card access, anyone can go to any floor. Today for most frequent travelers, security has now become a major priority and a hotel that will not upgrade their security to keep up with the times is a concern to us.  Food in several of the restaurants is good and"	Date of stay: February 2015

Manaswi G	Advantage lost over time??	With such a beautiful location and being one of oldest in business in the area. This looks like time had its toll on them and others working hard to exel have pushed them back further making the gap bigger. Worn out interiors in rooms and ordinary hospitality says it all.

geeta d	Good location but dated	Stayed for 1 night . Very dated. Needs renovation .wi fi chargeable which was very annoying. Buffet spread was very good for breakfast and dinner. Well worth it. Rooms were ok . Bath was dirty and black. The porters waited to get their trips which I don't agree .	Date of stay: January 2015
Sha1one	Not a 5star hotel	"Its not at all worthy. They claim its a 5 star hotel but if you look at the condition of the room, carpet, they all are pretty old and needs to be replaced. Also, from the so-called ""sea-view"" room, where I was staying, the sea view is not that good, due to the location of the hotel. Service is good and also staffs are helpful, that I must say. I am rating my experience ""Poor"" because I didn't get 5-star experience, which they claim in their website. In Colombo, this would have been a $100 hotel (max., for 1 person)."

It was all very happy happy feel until we reached our room. The room was so untidy and unclean as soon as we started to settle there, going through the bathroom it was so sick that they did not clean it properly where all over spotting strands of hairs and stuff in the closet, basin, floor. Then Air-condition was not upto the mark. We were so frustrated with the response of the people there, ll we wanted was a special sweet night and that too after a long car journey. Requesting for the change of room after wasting about an hour they finally said we would give you the best and upgrade it to a deluxe room on a high floor. Hearing all"	Date of stay: November 2014
Jagdish R	Decent hotel in the heart of the Colombo city	"We stayed here for just one night on our final leg of our 10 day long Sri Lanka holiday. This hotel is right in the middle of the CBD and faces the sea side and the rest of the wonderful Colombo city, so we get a very good view from the top floors (we stayed on the 11th floor!) of the hotel of the entire city both in the day and very good in the night! Service overall was just ok, but the place is a little old and needs a refresh. The breakfast buffet was just ok. They have a nice lobby area with restaurants, shops, etc. Rooms were ok, although the night we stayed, there was continuous brown water coming out of the hot water taps! It was really disappointing that such a Hotel charges for WIFI for guests!"	Date of stay: January 2015
XriLou	Less than 4 star hotel	"The hotel does not support the 4 stars claimed. It surely needs renovation. Common rooms are smelly and old. Rooms are not clean, smell a lot. Plumbing need to be restored immediately - they produce noise and are broken. Staff is not helpful and friendly. We had to change 3 times our room due to problems with noise and plumbing. Not worthy."	Date of stay: December 2014
Vinuz89	"Good stay, but ..."	"We stayed at the Galadari for a night as our flights were overbooked. The stay was sponsored by Srilankan Airlines. The hotel is good, rooms are clean and neat. The food is amazing, mix of Srilankan, Indian and Continental cuisines. The letter from the airlines said our accommodation, food and beverages, phone connectivity all shall be provided at the hotel. However, the room service was charged extra. Wifi was on chargeable basis. And the worst experience was when the  angry behavior of the front desk manager at 3am. The behavior was something that no customer will have to face. Really disappointed with his behavior. I wouldn't recommend the hotel because of this bad experience."	Date of stay: December 2014

Hema I	Good place to stay in Colombo	"A good location in Colombo city to stay in. A classic type hotel which looks historical. Rooms are very nicely maintained with quite responsive room service.   The food in all its restaurants (including the buffet breakfast/ lunch / dinner) is sumptuous and a good spread. If you are a vegan or vegetarian, then choices are little limited but the staff are willing to accomodate your preferences. So that is a plus! Continental, multi cuisine and Indian food options are available. So there is something for everyone.  Meter taxis are available at the door step of the hotel, making it very convenient for the guests to roam around. Service is also quite good. Will return again."	Date of stay: December 2014

ronh818	Good position	"The Galadari, despite its popularity did not enthuse me, it is difficult to pinpoint why as the the public areas were in good order except for the pool area which was drab, restaurants were ok but not ones to actively seek out.The bedrooms were fine although the outlook was industrial over what I assume was the kitchen complete with giant extra to fans.Wifi charges at 7USD per day per device was steep given that between us we had 2 tablets,2 phones and a camera.Needless to say we did not avail ourselves of more than one device.The hotels location is good overlooking the old parliament, and in close proximity to the beach,galle face green and the Dutch Hospital redevelopment.I can only put my disenchantment with the Galadari to the fact that we have stayed at much better hotels"	Date of stay: December 2014

MarkDodgson	Very dates	"The best thing about this hotel is the friendly staff. The second best thing is the California Grill which gave us a very nice evening, with excellent service. The worst thing is the rooms. Our room was very dated and worn. The bathroom would have been modern 30 years ago. Facilities in the room were very basic. The buffets in the main restaurant are good, where the Sri Lankan food is wonderful. The problem we had in the restaurant and in the whole reception area was the very loud and totally awful christmas 'music'."	Date of stay: December 2014

Our room was spacious and comfortable and we had a view of the coast.  Amenities were good and free wi-fi was available in the room as well.  I'm surprised with many of the reviews as our room appeared to be updated and our bathroom was very modern.  The breakfast buffet was extensive with local as well as international fare.  Staff was friendly and helpful in suggestions regarding what to see and in obtaining cabs. We would definitely consider staying here again.	Date of stay: November 2014

Its a nice hotel but a bit worn down - bare wires coming from the lamps, bits and pieces falling off. and leaking shower door There are a lot of restaurants in the establishment that are really good. I didn't really use any other of the facilities but it looked pretty good. The hotel is located centrally in the city and about an hour from the airport. Staff were polite and professional.

How friendly and helpful the staff is some thing that can not be explained in words. All the management staff and all the members of the staff make you feel so homely and they welcome you from the time you step on to the front steps of the hotel. Beginning with the doormen who will welcome you then the turn go to the bell boys, From there onwards every other member of staff can not wait to come and shake my hand to welcome. The words, welcome back sir, keep ringing in my ears as so many will see me and will speed up to welcome, how warm is that.

Surojit111	Decent hotel for overnight stay	"I had been to Galadhari with my family in December 2014. It is a decent hotel situated in the heart of Colombo. The rooms are spacious with decent amenities. However, this seems to be an old property. The rooms exhibited shades of patch repair works at a few places (ceiling and bathroom to be specific). The bathrooms seemed dated but have been well maintained. The views from the room are beautiful. The pool, lobby and restaurants are very well maintained – that is where we felt that this hotel deserved the 5 star tag it carried. The Indian restaurant in the hotel offers great food and is reasonably priced. The breakfast spread was awesome and as per international standards. The hotel has very good connectivity to the city.

Service is really great. Rooms at Kingsbury are modern and posh but little smaller than Galadari. Rooms in Galadari and as a matter of fact the whole hotel requires a little bit of maintenance. For veggie indian food lovers, i recommend Galadari and for europeans, americans and australians, i  recommend kingsbury. Both the hotels are close to each other and are rated very high."

The breakfast is excellent. I got a room on the 8th floor facing the sea and the views are magnificent.  Staff is friendly and courteous.

It seemed like an extremely happening hotel with lots happening all the time. Since we went in December the decor was christmasy and very festive. Loved it ! Although we checked into a non sea facing room, we were moved to it the next morning on our request. The staff at the hotel is very friendly, very courteous and extremely helpful.   Although the rooms ( we were on the 10th floor - Superior room) were large and well equipped, they were'nt really luxurious. A bit four starry.   POSITIVES Very large, Pleasant room, very clean.

ShonWata	An old hotel poor service but good food	"The building of this hotel is quite old and I sensed a bit of mold like smells in guest rooms.  What amazed me the most was room cleaning service during day time.  During my three nights stay, I always had a problem not finding enough towels supplied to the room.  One day after I returned to my room, I found no towels in my room.  I called and requested to supply it to me.  As I clearly communicated them that I have no towels in my room, I expected that they will supply me a set of towels, bath towel and face towels.  However, they only brought me a piece of bath towel, which surprised me.. This has been the regular practice throughout my stay.. Good food for breakfast and lunch at the lobby floor, for which I am giving an additional start."	Date of stay: December 2014

Arnab19	Nice hotel next to sea	"We landed at Colombo early in the morning and were put up at Galadari. It was very impressive from the word go. The hotel was just next to the sea and the best part was that we got a room that overlooked the sea. It was also not too far off from the city centre, Colombo as such is not too large a city though. Evenings or early mornings were the best time to stroll along the sea front and we enjoyed every bit of it. Rooms were very spacious and comfortable. The staff were cordial and very helpful.  The restaurant provides a wide choice of Continental and local cuisine as part of their buffet breakfast and dinner. We didn't get a chance to have lunch in the hotel, but I'm sure that it will be equally good and elaborate. It was overall a memorable stay at Galadari."	Date of stay: October 2014

Sejuti	Between average and very good	"The rating scale here should include a ""good"" category...cause that is what my experience of staying at Galadari Hotel falls into.   The good parts of Galadari: the location, the view from the window (even numbered rooms esp on floors above 8th have nice views of the Indian Ocean), the friendly staff, food at Sheherzade restaurant.  It does not qualify for the ""very good"" tag because of the following: average quality breakfast spread (even though the spread was extensive the quality wasn't much good), poor service (the staff are very friendly but either due to lack of training or for some other reason their quality of service is not so good). Wi-fi is on a chargeable basis (however, as i was part of a business group it was given for free).   The temperature was kept at very low"	Date of stay: November 2014

The breakfast spread is also very good. For those looking for Indian food the Flavours  serves good Indian food at a reasonable rate. The retail tea counter in the lobby has a great collection of tea. You can buy your tea here, The rates are also not more than those in the market. Go for a morning walk along the beach. It's a great pleasure. All in all a good place to stay. They also allowed us a late check out (4 pm) without any extra charge."	Date of stay: November 2014

Trutjful	Pleasant stay.	"We stayed at the hotel for three nights. The room was clean and staff very attentive. We are very picky with our bathrooms and these were perfect, nice clean tiles and facilities. Breakfast had a good range And was nice, nothing to write home about but , couldn't complain. Location is great as it is a  small walk to galle face, fort and pettah markets."	Date of stay: November 2014

marishat_13	Good!!	"We were put up at another hotel where our experience was not very pleasant thereafter we changed our hotel and shifted to galadari for two nights.

TonyMachin	Great hotel in a great location	i stayed here for 4 nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. It is located across from the ocean Gand the rooms on that side have a great view. The staff are very friendly and always ready to assist. I was able to find some interesting shopping places close by but if you have a chance to visit Odel then do so. There is a speciality tea centre in the foyer which has a great range. I recommend this hotel for anyone who is visiting Colombo and would certainly stay here again.	Date of stay: October 2014
SUNILDASWANEY	GALADARI HOTEL	We got a room which had an outstanding view as it was facing the sea.This was a proper 5 star hotel which was perfect in every way except that the  wifi was chargeable anywhere in the hotel including the lobby.We had a choice of continental and arabic buffets at dinner time.the presentation and variety of the continental buffet was very good.All in all i would recommend this  hotel.

Jiayang Y	great location	"the hotel needs a facelift, but my overall experience is good.  The location is great, very close to the beach and the dutch hospital shopping and dining area.

michael b	Book in at ocean view side and rethink hotel organised trips.	"We had a room at the back of the hotel so no sea views! Staff were helpful at all times, but I agree with other people that it is slightly jaded and needs an up date. However rooms were serviced early and always to a high standard. Food was average. Breakfast had a variety of options but no muesli, unflavoured yogurt etc for my western palette so disappointing. Be aware of trips organised by the hotel. We are of course aware that drivers get a cut in places they take you to, but we were tired of constantly saying no to our driver. Maybe the hotel could give a list of places you may want to visit on your planned trip and you tick off those you are interested in seeing. Other than those ...stick to the planned route!!! I know one of our drivers made a killing in a sapphire shop he"	Date of stay: August 2014

Nalinda B	"Sheherazade, an authentic experience!"	"While the Galadari has a few theme restaurants, the arabic restaurant Sheherazade is a true authentic experience of arabic cuisine to be found in Sri Lanka.  The dinner buffet to which I took one of my guests from the UAE, was well presented with many nice dishes and desserts.  The chicken shorba was quite flavorful and and the nice selection of shawarmas and hummus was much liked by my guest.  There were also many types of kebabs on offer and the kabsa and the couscous as typical mains among others were nicely made.  The arabic pita bread that was served hot and fresh from the oven tasted exquisite.  The baklawa which I tasted for the first time is considered to be a top dessert and it was easy to see why and the muhalabia which according to my guest tasted really authentic was"	Date of stay: September 2013

kovaitravelwriter	Good old hotel but needs updating of fecilities.	Very good location.Large rooms with ver lively lobby.But you can see the property is not been updated for a long time..Cant sustain on old glory..Food is good the Middleeastern food on room service was bad and no semblence to Arabic taste..Must look into this very seriously..Otherwise i will recommend this hotel...The rooms in the road side is very noicy with traffic..so go to top floors on sea view.

traveltodaytravel	A very pleasant stay!	"Its a nice hotel and if you are with family or a group of friends you shall have a nice time. Its a little old in comparison to the newer hotels around so it sums up to be a 4 star deluxe and not a 5 star hotel as per our experience.   Having said that, nothing takes away the pleasantries of the hotel. The staff is extremely friendly, right from the Gate keeper, to the security officers to the general staff, they all greet you with an extremely warm Sri Lankan smile no matter what time of day or night.  The location of the hotel is excellent, it is right next to the ocean, request for a seaview room and you shall have a view of both their old presidential buildings and the sea. The rooms are pretty big, The only complaint was that the Air conditioning in some of the rooms was"	Date of stay: August 2014

SLYeh	Average hotel trying to pass off as 5 star	"When we recently stayed 2 nights; we found the service quite inconsistent. Front desk at check-in was quite unfriendly and the tone would even probably be construed as rude by some. Concierge was friendly and helpful. Depending on which housekeeping staff you spoke with, you may or may not get your request attended to. Staff at the ground floor international coffee house were the only ones that consistently provided friendly and prompt service be it the restaurant manager, the waitress or the chefs (we dined there on 3 occasions). Alas the quality and selection of the buffet spreads was slightly lacking compared to the other hotels in Sri Lanka that we stayed during our tour. Overall, whilst location is good, we found the hotel to be a bit old and slightly rundown at the edges."	Date of stay: August 2014
SujoyKanjilal	Business Trip to Sri Lanka	"I went to Colombo, on a 4 day business trip last week. I stayed in the Galadari Hotel. My experience was very good. The room which I was given was a room with a view. I had the Galle Face Road & the Expanses of the Ocean at one go. The view was simply 'WOW"". The hotel although an old structure, was well maintained and very nice. The room size was really big. The Breakfast & the Lunch buffet spread is also very good, especially the separation of the different menus like Sri Lankan, Continental, Indian etc. The hotel staff were very helpful & always jovial. The different restaurants with in the hotel are also very nice & the food quality and spread was nice. The vicinity to the main business center of Colombo is the best part of this Hotel. This hotel has a colonial charm to it,"	Date of stay: July 2014
profjoypc	Excellent location and superb service	"We have visited and eaten in this hotel on many occasions, mainly for business meetings. It is in an ideal location for exploring Colombo by three wheeler. Shops, other hotels and restaurants, the Galle Face Green and other attractions are all very close. The hotel buffets are excellent and there are many other dining options. The hotel is immaculately clean and service is of a very high standard. As one of the 'top flight' hotels in the city it does not disappoint. Prices are comparable with other large hotels of is kind. We recommend it."	Date of stay: July 2014

Sadie K	Just basic	"I was complementary offered a stay in galadari because of delay in my flight so I don't know much about the prices .  This hotel is right next to Hilton Colombo and these are only two hotels that are fitting for foreigners stay . Galadari can be described in one word ""stale"" old dirty carpets . Old window panes and one thinks he is still living in early 80's .  Service was very good though . The bell boys an all the staff put on a good show to make up for the buildings shortcomings . Breakfast buffet is very lavish and delicious .  The view from window of my room was good too the window opens to beach . All in all it was an average experience keeping in mind that it was a complementary stay. If I had paid for it I would have been very disappointed ."	Date of stay: July 2014
EWayC	old hotel	"i have stayed here twice for business trip. the only plus side of this hotel is the seaview. other than that, not worth staying because it is old and expensive.  not worth the money to spend on staying here.   walking distance to dutch hospital for food."	Date of stay: March 2014
Anita826	Former Glory	"The hotel is well located in Galle Face. I had a sea facing room. So, the view was fantastic. The service was excellent. However, the hotel is past its prime. Except for the lobby area, the hotel badly needs a refurbishment. The rooms, though very spacious, were in bad shape with torn carpet and old furnishings. So, if you are fussy about rooms, you may want to look for a different hotel. The buffets were very elaborate. I stayed at this hotel as part of a conference. Although the service was excellent, I will not stay here again until the hotel renovates its rooms. By the way, one of the highlights is the pool area, which is worth visiting. Given the location, the good food, and the friendly service, I hope that the hotel starts refurbishing soon. Sad to see a formerly glorious"	Date of stay: June 2014

Divij S	Old Hotel but with out the panache!	"We stayed here in September. The hotel is approx. 40 minutes away from the airport. We stayed for 3 days in the hotel, it was a travel agent booked accommodation. I had similar buffets during this trip in other star hotels at Kandy and bentota, and I must say I was slightly disappointed with the buffet here. the service was the main reasons for my disappointment . The questions on what was on offer were not answered; we had to call the waiters many times before they served us tea on the table. And mind you the restaurant was not too crowded. Though I am a non-vegetarian the spread is a bit of a disappointment for an herbivore.       The lamb had a strong odor (of not very good quality), though the grill sauce was good. There was a Japanese Yakitori (chicken on skewers in a soy"	Date of stay: September 2013

A real decent property which will bring out a real value for money proposition foe the travellers.rooms are spacious ( I had a suite, which was a combination of two rooms attached together, staff is friendly and helpful and location fantastic.  One glitch though. The internet is not complimentary. And even if you purchase a package, it is valid only on one device. So, if you have two devices, you need to take two packages. Dear management at the hotel...the world has migrated way ahead in terms of providing internet to its patrons. Pls catch up fast."	Date of stay: May 2014

Old fashioned manners are to the fore from the staff. It reminded me of a bygone age. Only disappointment was the room. Spacious, but needed modernising badly. But bed was really comfy. Didn't complain as was on a biz trip; so no problem for me. Staff couldn't help enough. Brilliant value. pay in local currency for value."	Date of stay: May 2014

siddharth c	April stay - City center	"We stayed here in April and this happened to be the time when sinhalese new year was being celebrated in colombo. The streets were absolutely dead. On the brighter side, we had the entire hotel to ourselves. The hotel is approx. 40 minutes away from the airport. All the shopping malls are very close by. The staff is very helpful and the food was average. However, the down side was that the hotel was charging for wifi though you get it for free at pretty much all the hotels worldwide. There is a place called the Dutch hospital which has some fantastic restaurants. This is literally a 2 minute walk from the hotel. Most recommended.  Overall good hotel, will visit again."

Zainal A	Transit hotel in Colombo	"My wife and I were given this hotel while on transit in Colombo on our return flight from London to Kuala Lumpur. The Galadari is a large hotel.  We were given a good room with all the amenities. The hotel in general looks a bit dated (especially the carpets along the corridors and in the room). Staff are friendly and attentive. All arrangements i.e. airport transfers, meals etc were well taken care of by Sri Lankan staff at the transit desk. We were impressed with the variety of food served at the buffet. However, we found Srilankan dishes rather spicy inspite of coming from a country like Malaysia.  My disappointment was there was no free WiFi even at public places.  You have to pay for Wifi.  In this day and age, WiFi should be either free in rooms or at least at public"	Date of stay: May 2014

fat_bloke_up_hills	Staff were good... hotel however...	"Emirates kicked us into this hotel when their plane failed in Male... I hope Emirates got a discount... Now there are some good points: Staff - the front line staff could not have been more helpful, however, as soon as you give them a jacket they take on an attitude! Also the location is interesting... and right next to the sea.  Downside, it is VERY old, everything is tired. By no stretch of anyone's imagination could this possibly be a 5 star hotel, by international standards the rooms are, at best, 2* I would choose a UK budget hotel over this. So main issue was when I was checked in I was allocated a room on the 5th floor, which had clearly been taken off for maintenance - the floor - not the room, as the public lift would not stop there! After returning to reception, I got"	Date of stay: April 2014

Abeer Zaidi	Nice stay there!	"I have been to hotels that are better than Galadari but since we are talking about Colombo so, I think that its a great hotel. I was a bit disappointed that my reservation was not there when I reached the hotel. I had to call my tour agent to confirm whether he made the reservation or not. He was all clear from his side and later we came to know that the problem was from the hotel itself. Anyhow, after like half an hour they gave me the keycards and I checked in to my room. The rooms are spacious and we had the Galle facing view room so it was good. Room service was extraordinary with great food. Dining at one of the restaurants named Flavors is a must there. I have never had Indian cuisine that good before. I believe I will stay there again if I get a chance to visit Colombo"	Date of stay: December 2013
kiki_kiwi_11	"Nice hotel, if a bit expensive"	"The Galadari hotel is well placed next to Galle Green and also beside the Hilton. I arrived at the airport at 2am, and a Galadari car taxi driver was there to pick me up and deliver me to the hotel. Usually the cars are much mre expensive than normal taxis (kangaroo etc), and the trip cost alsmot 5,000 rupees, although it does take around 30-40 minutes, so I guess reasonable when you consider the trip.   The lobby and ground floors of the hotel are very nicely presented. I was quickly checked in and the hotel staff were prompt and helpful to assist me, although the main motivation is tipping. My host during my stay ensured my hotel room was upgraded and on the 11th floor (near the top of the hotel) with lovely views and a fruit basket on arrival. The room was clean and tidy and"	Date of stay: April 2014

Hotel is securely situated near to many official buildings with lots of surveillance and security. Just behind the hotel is the ocean side which is serene with no crowd and apt cleanliness. Hotel itself is quite good although a little old property but well maintained. The buffet breakfast was lavish with many varieties of local ‘sambal’ a Sri Lankan signature dish. The menu consisted other international selections as well which were quite good."	Date of stay: May 2013

But the foremost important part, the room was in very poor condition. The room is pretty old and not at all suitable for a holiday (may be okay for a business trip).  The carpet is pretty old and have the visual signs of its age. The window of the room is having very old fabricated frame and does not open. If you succeed in opening the window, you would not be able to close it. The part of the window frame is broken and I had to get the help of room service to get the window closed. Room service is pretty poor, if you request for any item, no guarantee that it would be available for you. I had repeatedly requested for a fruit knife,"	Date of stay: March 2014

barking1RedondoBeach	First three days In SL	"After a long flight from Los Angeles was anxious to see where we would be staying for 3 nights, knew it was a city hotel and the reviews online were mixed. We reached the property, looked like a big hotel, lobby was nice, over from the beach too. We were upgraded to a suite on the 10th floor. Room was dated and in need of an over haul but seemed clean and had all that we really needed, the view was great, ocean view and right next door to the Presidents office and a few buildings away from where he and his family live so a secure area. The Hotel staff did warn us not to use the Tuk Tuks outside, but we did and they were fine. Twice men came up to us and said that they worked in the Hotel and said that they would make sure they got us one that would not rip us off, just a hoax,"	Date of stay: February 2014

Disappointed to find that the so-called ""Grand Ballroom"" had only a small makeshift floor where the edges of the panels laid on the floor were not even level with our shoes catching on the uneven gaps.  In Sri Lanka traditionally New Year's Eve dances go all night and generally finish around dawn.  So we were very disappointed when the senior band in attendance Mirage didn't return to play when Replay (the second band) finished just after 3 am.  They decided they had enough and shut down the dance even though there were people like us who wanted more and were waiting to dance for another couple of hours at least given the Sri Lankan tradition.  Mirage was the more professional band on the night but they certainly didn't do"	Date of stay: December 2013
Frankclean	Traditional Stay	"Located very close to the beach, this is one of the best place to choose. Pure business hotel with warmth of service. You can feel the service with a traditional ambience. Good food and clean rooms. Will visit again with family."	Date of stay: August 2013
jetsetter1960	Great stay	"I should start my review by acknowledging the GM of the hotel for the hospitality offered to us - a family reunion after 27 years.   Nothing was an issue.  Thanks Sampath. Hotel is central to everything - a number of large hotels in the vicinity, commercial center of Fort just around the corner and the beach across the Galle face green (just across the road).  Good music lounge/night club in the hotel - Margarita Blue with the resident band one of the best in the country. Some sections of the hotel are slightly dated - however this is one of the older properties in Colombo and renovations are in progress.  Upper floors are renovated and fabulous view of the ocean stretching out to Mt Lavinia beach on one side of the building. Breakfast was a spread - great service and choice of"	Date of stay: December 2013
la_speranza	"A tad old but still very nice, consider the price"	"I had a good experience staying there doing the new year's eve, total of 4 nights. My room was on 12th floor, absolutely no noise, the view of Galle face was a real treat! I admit the hotel is old and needs refurbishing badly, but overall, everything is clean and works. On the 12th floor we have the choice of taking our breakfast at their lounge there, overlooking the ocean, instead of going down to the lobby.   Bed is comfortable, bathroom facility is sufficient. Although the water pressure for the flushing toilet is weak. Wi fi in room is not free, unfortunately. However, if you are like me, purchase a sim card at the airport at the mere cost of Rs1,300, you have 1.5 G of data to travel with you, no need for any wi fi.   The hotel is an easy walk to Old Dutch hospital complex,"	Date of stay: January 2014
Laura C	Nice hotel but way too much A/C	"Nice, well located hotel in Colombo. You get a nice view on the beach. The staff is really nice and helpful. Although the rooms are aging a little with the carpets and bathroom that aren't so shiny and up to date, they are spacious and clean. The buffet was good with a lot of varieties, but they are crazy with the A/C, we almost got sick in there!"	Date of stay: December 2013

Magiccarpetride2	average at best	Not sure what earned this place it's five star rating. We spent a night here after a late night flight into Colombo and thank god that's what it was limited to. The carpets in the room were stained and the room and bath itself was very dated and could do with a good sprucing up. Annoyingly when u get in that late you really want to sleep well. We had to draw the thick curtains because Christmas lights were dangling outside the window which the hotel refused to turn off. Breakfast was a good spread. Adequate for an overnight trip but will not go back.	Date of stay: December 2013

shalini s	High tea at Galadari is mediocre	I had high tea at Galadari with a group of friends recently. The cost was 1450/= per person. The food was pathetic. The pastries had very little filling and were cold.  I couldn't finish any as none of them tasted nice. The only good dish was the Thai noodles and roast chicken. The two sushi and sashimi dishes were ok. The meal was not at all worth the money. Will not be going there again.	Date of stay: December 2013

Lahmazani Yati	Everything just not with this hotel!!	"Having 5 nights spent here for my business trip. Arriving at 2am with long hour flight and transit time just made me very tired. The staff not friendly like we expected them to be in 5 star hotels to behave! The hotel just smelly, old hotel, with good location near beach. The room was big, smelly off course and all the furnitures just looked old and not maintained properly. First day, my room was not made up. Simply because I forget to hang sign ""please make my room"" in the door. My phone in the room can't be used. Told the reception to ask housekeeping clean my room and fix my phone before I went out for dinner. Nothing happened!! The next day I complained again, and finally they respond it as should be. No free Wifi at all! The food for breakfast and lunch not tasty and do not"	Date of stay: November 2013
Yogesh Srivastava	Great Place to be in Colombo.	"Galadari is one of the best properties in Colombo ideally located on sea shore . It is also  the oldest 5 star property in Colombo.  Service is par excellence.  Food is ultimate for gastronomic senses and taste buds. Overall a very nice and memorable experience.  Must try Arabic food with Hukka at Sheherzade and Indian food at Flavours. Executive Club Rooms have breakfast served at Lounge ,  boosting your ego and making you feel elitely different . Highly recommended. If you don't stay in this hotel while in Colombo,  you have missed Colombo."	Date of stay: November 2013
Sashika H	High tea is super	Had a great time on the high tea. really enjoyed it. The food was excellent. The Variations is also great. The atmosphere was excellent and have to mention that the services also maintain well. Hope to visit again for a high tea.	Date of stay: October 2013
jktomjk	Colombo Hotel	This is a old hotel and rooms are not maintained properly. Location wise this is centrally located. If you are own a business trip this is ok. I cant suggest this hotel if you are on a holiday.

Ritwik Bhowmik	Nice Business Hotel	"This was my 1st visit to Colombo on business and stayed at Hotel Galadari, a renowned 5 star out there! I presume the hotel is vintage in Colombo by the type of interiors it had, looked slightly outdated to me! The rooms were very spacious, nicely maintained, the sea view from the 11 floor was quite nice and refreshing! Staff grooming was a mixed bag, some were nice while others not so nice. Special mention for the housekeeping staff who were prompt, rendered superb service. The travel desk was very efficient too. The in house restaurant served decent food although I was expecting something more, the breakfast however had a huge spread and one is spoilt for choices. The location of the hotel is perfect and central to your business and personal needs. All in all, I wouldn't mind"	Date of stay: October 2013
MysteryJunkiesBLR	"Mostly Business, but...."	"The Galadari is a nice business hotel located in Colombo next to the world trade center. I only stayed one night but the staff, the room, the ambience, the management and the ""feeling"" was all positive.  Arrived late night on the 10th of October, checked out by afternoon on the 11th. The room I had was airy and clean, 10th floor with a good view outside - although I only realized it the the next morning.   What I do remember and like is that I forgot my spectacles in the room and could only return after four days (before I was scheduled to fly out of Colombo). I didn't get a chance to call or even check if my spectacles were there. However, when I arrived on the 15th, they were courteous, prompt and very quick in locating my spectacles and returning it to me.   That act alone"	Date of stay: October 2013
Mathew John	Great hotel and service	"This was my second visit to Hotel Galadari. The check in was average , I had a wait of 15 minutes due to some confusion. The hotel not very modern, but quite good. The rooms and bathrooms were clean. The toiletries were average but quite OK. The room service was quite good and they keep inquiring if any help is needed.  The USP is the food. The dinner menu at the Coffee Shop in outstanding with all sorts of seafood. The rooms have a great view of the sea and secretariat. Check out was smooth.  They would need to modernise the hotel a bit, otherwise quite great. Great location ."	Date of stay: October 2013

Srinivasa T	Good! but.....!	My self and 4 of my friends(All are doctors) stayed in this hotel for two days. Food and Hospitality was good. Rooms are OK. Today even small hotels are providing the complementary WiFi but here it is chargeable. This is only negative mark for this hotel..	Date of stay: September 2013
Jennifer P	Less then impressive	Hotel in desperate need of a revamp. The rooms were musty and the bedclothes did not smell fresh. Only had one night fortunately and did not get the wake-up call requested and then had to get cross to get someone to organise a taxi to the airport!  Probably only qualifies as 5 star based on its historic grandeur.	Date of stay: August 2013
Ranjiv	Needs revamp	All aspects of this once great hotel need a definite revamp. From the restaurants to the ballroom to the rooms need complete facelift.   Cafe 64 is just awful. Whats a cafe without fresh juice and serving artificially flavoured fruit cordials?  Its competing heavily against a number of 5 Star properties all around it and unless refurbished like the Kingsbury did this hotel is doomed for a natural death.	Date of stay: September 2013
shaneel	not as i expected	can get the cigarate smell in the hallway...wifi facilities should be available in the rooms on the smart phones....everytime we had to reactivate our room keys and that was a pain...gym should open say 5am....staff were really nice and friendly though......would expect something better for 5 star rating....

Henyo	Worst hotel stay	"Room is average. Service is poor. The management should seriously think of sending the staff for customer service training. No one is greeting unless you are the one who greet first. The staff in executive floor doesn't even look at you to acknowledge your presence, always pretending to write or read something on her paper. The breakfast service is always chaotic.   The rate is quite high but you will not get the service that you need. You should think of going to another five star property if you want to have a peaceful trip."	Date of stay: August 2013
Globalreviewer12	3 star hotel at 5 star price	"I am not sure where to start with this hotel.  First...i supposedly had a good rate...at 220,000 (about 150 usd) and that is simply too much for what I got (room and a breakfast).  The room is very tired...mattress worn out....and the breakfast was minimal.  There was alot of food out...but it wasn't good and i think most of it came from the night before.  Service in general is only average but some things really irk you....they just COME IN your room around 0800 to clean your room.....so put the bar across the lock unless you want them to just walk in.  They do not wait for answer and come absurdly early.  The laundry service is reasonably priced but they don't deliver when expected and you have to call.  If you don't and it is on weekend..they call YOU at 0800.  Again absurd."	Date of stay: August 2013
MusaratK	Not 5 star!	"Stayed at the Galadari in Colombo, Sri Lanka for 1 night in mid-August. After spending 3 nights at Lavanga Resort & Spa - 5 star luxury beach resort in Hikkaduwa and 3 nights in Dickwella Resort & Spa. We arrived at Galadari mid afternoon. The lobby/reception area was very busy. 3 of us checked into a twin room which was on a 'smokers' floor and we complained it smelt but nothing was done to change our room. The hotel is and is showing its age in many places-carpets, curtains & towels need replacing. At breakfast time a fuss was made about one of us needing to pay as we'd only booked for 2 people-an error on their part. Wifi connection had to be paid for-which many customers complained about. In London this would kind of hotel would be classed as 3 star or lower."	Date of stay: August 2013
Steve F	"Tired, Expensive and Average Service"	"Our Travel guys booked me into the Galadari Hotel for 3 nights while on business in Colombo in July. Arrived at the hotel around 11pm. Nobody to take the bags out of the car to reception. Staff at the desk were friendly enough and after an effortless check in I was taken to my room on the top floor executive room.  The Room: - Good size - Bed hard as a rock - furniture old and should be replaced - room was musty  - bathroom was in really poor state. mould in corners, broken door - aircon controls, either freezing or to hot  Breakfast was included and at best I would call it slop suitable for a dog. poor selection and poor quality food.  Internet - poor at best using wifi. Note that if you log in with your phone and laptop you will be charged twice, the internet charges are per"	Date of stay: July 2013
RV4Pilot	Very satisfied	"Stayed at the Galadari in Colombo, Sri Lanka for two nights on business in mid-August.  The hotel is located on the sea front in ‘down town’ Colombo opposite the very beautifully restored old Parliament building.  On arrival the greeting is courteous and efficient.  All the staff were friendly, helpful and professional throughout my visit.  The public rooms are clean, well-appointed and very pleasant.  A lack of time meant that I was not able to do a full exploration but there were shops on the ground floor in the lobby, three restaurants (main hotel, Arabic & Indian) and an outdoor swimming pool.  The rooms I had (two separate nights) were clean and functional but were staring to look a bit tired.  They had the usuall range of things, tea / coffee making facilities, mini bar,"	Date of stay: August 2013
SierraBravo	"Very good place, but shows age..."	"Hotel Galadari is located at a prestigious location on Lotus Road, in the heart of Colombo. It appears to have been built in the 1970s, and is showing its age in some places. But for most part, it is a well-run hotel and my experience has been very positive.  I stayed at Galadari for four nights in August 2013. The room was largish, with two queen-sized beds. The room had a decent view of the Indian ocean (partly obstructed by the adjacent buildings). The window had a sticker advising against using cameras, binoculars or video cameras from the window for 'security reasons'.   The room was quite clean, and had well-stocked mini-bar (which I did not use). The toilet was spacious and had a bath tub, sufficient toilet supplies and also had instant hot water. There was a coffee maker"	Date of stay: August 2013
Tra_Wel	Stay away ...	"The Galadari Hotel may actually be one of the worst 4-star hotels I have stayed at. Despite their good location and courteous staff (sadly that does not make them helpful) , their lack of competence in running basic operations was astonishing. Rooms are dated - as if left alone since the 1980s. Corridors are smelly, carpets dusty, windows dirty, furniture old and worn, and the room walls painted an antispectic pale yellow. Security and signs warning you about touts and scams are overwhelming.  I will list the issues we faced in order of appearance:  - At check-in, we were told there was wifi available but this would charged @ USD 7/ day per device. We said we were surprised to get charged for wifi - our other hotels all over sri lanka provided this free - reception told us this"	Date of stay: August 2013

The bathroom needs urgent renovation, and the bamboo furnitures are absolutely inadequate for a quality city hotel.  Some of the rooms are facing the sea, with good views if you are in a high floor, but the windows are so dirty that you don'y even see the sea.  In general it's a hotel for bussiness but incredibly wifi IS PAYABLE (the only of the 8 hotels I have stayed in Sri Lanka this summer, where wifi is payable, even in the lobby) !! The food is excellent, with a large variety in the buffet and a good quality, and the staff is very friendly and helpfull, and seems to be used to solve problems with efficiency.

TourJockey	Old Hotel at Good Location	This hotel was recommended by friend who had stayed in the past. I had booked Executive room so i get a decent room to stay and it was not that expensive. Hotel certainly is in good location and also has very lively atmosphere. Staff at Front office and Restaurant are very courteous and offer best service. if management refurbishes the hotel then i guess it will be one of the best hotel in Colombo.

Aktham E	Great to be back again	"I had a bad experience once, I went to another hotel during my previous trip to Colombo, but this time I thought I would give it a chance and return to the Galadari.

Though I was offered the Executive Floor with lounge access sea view room with breakfast and Dinner, still if the hotel is fairly new then all the other extras which I mentioned will be a pleasure to use. Sorry to say this is an ageing hotel. The rooms r in horrible condition. Furniture is bad. toilets r old with dim lighting. Corridors are smelly the elevators r probably 25 years old. In fact as a kid I had stayed at the Galadari some 25 years back. It was the Galadari Meridian, but now Meridian has pulled out. The hotel is the same that it was when I stayed as a kid. Needs major renovation. Everything looks old and used and abused! There is absolutely nothing to write about positively for this hotel. How"	Date of stay: February 2013

bis74	Stop over stay	We visited the hotel on 29 june and we arrive at 9:30 pm and the check in was fast and we have 2 rooms connected. In the night the it took us 40 min to arrive from the airport to the hotel. In the lobby I seen that they have shisha and I enjoyed it. Next day we rent a car from the hotel for 5 hours and spend our time shopping and sightseeing and eat our lunch out side.  And when we arrive at hotel we was late and it takes us 90 min to reach to the airport.and it was only 1 hour and 10 min before our flightddeparture time.  So be careful to leave the hotel before at least 3 hours from your flight departure.	Date of stay: June 2013

Vagabondanil	Perfect Choice	"My family thoroughly enjoyed our rather brief one night stay stay at the Galadari. All said and done about the dated interiors the hotel is very well maintained. Staff were fantastic - Doorman, Reception, Restaurant, House Keeping all very polite ever smiling. I think if you are not too fussy this is a great place to be in. We were given a sea facing room and the view was lovely. Being from Mumbai sea views are not uncommon to us but we still enjoyed comparing it to Marine Drive. We opted for half board (break fast and dinner) and the food was lovely. I suggest all travelers especially vegetarians to do the same. I am ok with non- veg but did not miss it at all. It was our first day in Sri Lanka and all the skepticism was thrown in the deep blue Indian Ocean."	Date of stay: May 2013

Yes the decor is a little dated (as mentioned in previous reviews) but it is not so bad and the location is excellent and the staff very pleasant and helpful.  The food was very good and my room, overlooking the ocean, was large and very clean as were the public areas of the hotel.  My only niggle was the charge for internet (although that is typical in many hotels) and the fact that the room safe was not big enough for a laptop.  I will stay at the Galadari again."

When I enter the bathroom I saw a broom left behind in the middle of the bath tub!!! Overall housekeeping seems to be not up to the mark. It was the executive floor and there is another reception desk close to the lift.

Check-in was swift and efficient, however the room we stayed in was not what you would expect from a 5* property - rattan furniture, very tired decor and a general 'down-beat' feel. However, the view from the room was amazing - out over the Galle Face coast and Parliament buildings.

Check in went smooth whereas check out was abit late compared to. Anyway that did not bother us as we were on our vacation to Sri Lanka. But if we were on Business, it would have made a big issue. So please be aware of it to protect the good service of the hotel.  Thank You"	Date of stay: March 2013

Preeti A	Classic style!	"Its an old property, but fairly well maintained. Rooms are fine, but bathrooms are small. Lobby, restaurants and bar are very nice. Good food, good drinks and great music. They have friendly staff, good travel desk and nice little tea shop. Like most 5 star hotels in Colombo, they offer complimentary drop and some free chips for casinos. Overall, a comfortable, friendly hotel."	Date of stay: January 2013

thebellinnatlacock	like sleeping in a cheap 70s motel	"without doubt an excellent location and perhaps we were just unlucky to have a room on the 11th floor but it was terrible.  When you stepped out of the lift the floor smelt musty and the room cannot have been updated since it opened with 70s rattan furniture, a depressing bathroom with chipped tiles and greasy broken light fittings and ripped blankets on the bed. The public areas were good and the food and staff very good but not what we were expecting of a 5 star hotel"	Date of stay: March 2013
AbbhinavT	treat in colombo	"On my previous visits i have stayed at Taj but this time i wanted to check out another property and was delighted by the experience at Galadari. reached hotel very early 5am and the staff was courteous enough to not let us wait long for check-in. The rooms are comfortable a bit smaller as compared to others but roomy. breakfast spread was good and so was the chinese restaurant where chef catered to the specific taste that i wanted. I liked the rooftop pool as well as the porch cafe seating just outside the premises. The beach is just walking distance and everything comes to life in the evening. The call rates are a bit steep and so is the cab from the hotel, i would recommend the cab from outside which comes at almost half the price. i missed the vast landscaping that was there"	Date of stay: August 2012

As we were getting our food a pesorn whom we later worked out was the supervisor came to us and aplogised fo not giving a place in the high tea area and said that there is a place reserved for us. All was well and the staff meber was very courteous.  As for the high tea - there was a great variety of savoury and sweet items.

eroych	Best located property	"The Galadari Hotel is situated in the Fort area - bang in front of the sea face. Many tourist attractions like Galle Face, Pettah Market and premium restaurants at Old Dutch hospital are walking distance from the hotel. The view from the rooms overlook the Galle sea face and is simply fascinating.  The hotel is a very nice property with multiple restaurants. The breakfast at the coffee shop is quite good with continental, oriental as well as Sinhalese food. The rooms are large and clean with a sea view."	Date of stay: March 2013
nilmadole	Convenient	"Despite being pricey, the Galadari hotel is a good business and family hotel where you can relax, unwind and chill. Unlike most Colombo five-star hotels that have pricey room rates, food is not as expensive as it seems. If you book the room only, you can eat at the Cafe 64 which has to be the reasonably-priced hotel coffee shop in Colombo. Short eats nominally priced at less than Rs.100 and a delicious buriyani lunch at just below Rs.500, you can have a delightful holiday without breaking the bank. It's a good tip for travellers, of course there are cheaper restaurants around Colombo but Cafe 64 food is made to five-star standards and their desserts and cakes are to die for. Moreover, the hotel's buffet at the Coffee Shop is also reasonably priced and if you're in the mood for"	Date of stay: April 2012

But has the hotel done enough to keep with the location? I doubt.Food was OK. Service was so, so.. The front desk managed by not particularly help ful staff, travel desk is even worse but if you keep your expections to a minimum, and would like to romance the sea then look no further."

Maguder D	I liked the location and price. Not perfect but OK hotel.	"I dont know how much this costs for Japanese visitors. I stayed under local business man`s reserve and it was really reasonable. So I did not care about some problems in the room. I can see the sea (well not so attractive but better than nothing.)  Overall it doesnt worth paying more than 60$,I would say.

We flew into Colombo late at night and were scheduled to take a train early the next morning. So for us the hotel was just a place to sleep for a few hours.... and that's basically all it offered.  Pretty disappointed. but to be fair, i should probably be disappointed at the agodo hotel booking website for its false advertising than anything else..."	Date of stay: February 2013

SBhatt87	Ok stay...but definitely would not class it as a 5*!	"We stayed in this hotel for an evening after a poor experience at a different place of residence in Colombo. I had come for business with 3 other colleagues.  4 of us arrived late in the evening, approximately at 11pm, trying to get a room. The reception didn't want to know, at first, but then managed to find a room, which we appreciated, although it took nearly an hour.   It cost £70 for the 4 of us, which was quite cheap, however the room wasn't great either. I'd like to note the visit was in August 2011, and therefore the hotel may have improved since then.  Essentially, the room was very dated, with old wallpaper, carpets and furniture. The wallpaper was coming off in places, with cracks across the ceiling.

The Galadari hotel was just your next average 5 star hotel with 4-5 restaurants, a bar and a pub in the hotel. The rooms were big and spacious, but the carpeting needs changing, looked old, seems like a hotel which has not done its renovations in awhile and they need to do so. The location was great its right next to the beach and not to far from the city. The hotel has a pool and is over looking the beach. The food was good nothing great to speak about.

They are in stiff competition w the Cinamon Grand and the Hilton Colombo, which are newer & do have the Western niches.  Galadari lobby is very opulent and a sight onto itself.  I appreciated the nice welcoming touch of fresh flowers and fruit in my room (Executive Level).  The breakfast was perfect, as were the views from my room.  I even appreciated the guard who'll walk w you to the ATM (outside the hotel)."	Date of stay: December 2012
Praveens1	Average amenities with very low value for money	"We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights in December 2012. The hotel draws you in with a well maintained lobby but the rooms are a far cry from what you would expect for the room rate. The room we stayed at had poor fixtures and poor drainage.  In our first room the central light control did not function properly and the entrance light did not work altogether. We had to call maintenance to fix it. We also took another room during the same stay and experienced the same - poorly maintained rooms. In the second room, the shower drain stopper was hanging loose altogether. For the price paid, this hotel is not worth the money. Please reconsider your stay at this hotel."	Date of stay: December 2012

That meant i had the opportunity to check out on all meals on offer there :-))  Let me start of first with the Hotel itself - Nice, clean, spacious rooms and if your room is overlooking the beach then its quite a spectacular view. Do insist on higher floors though :-)) The property is probably a little old hence the spacious rooms and that makes it nice & comfy.  There is a reasonably good choice of food outlets - indian, middle eastern, grill & the coffee shop. I did try out the buffet at the coffee shop and had lunch at the indian restaurant as well. As an Indian i will be probably critical of the food served at the Indian restaurant. So, suffice to say - good but not spectacular !! The buffet service at the"	Date of stay: October 2012
Bruc78	Badly needs refurbishment	"This hotel is without any doubt the worst five stars hotel I have ever stayed. The room (on the 10th floor) had a nice view on the ocean, clean sheets, a decent (though small) bathroom with a nice shower and a large bed. Apart from this, the furniture was old, the room smelled like a barn and there was no way to adjust the temperature in-between freezing cold and hot like hell. Therefore, it was extremely unpleasant to stay in the room to sleep or to work. When I learned that I was in one of the ""recently-renovated"" floors, I could not believe it. Many other guests who were participating to the same conference as me shared the same impressions. The food served in the Indian restuarant was average, as was the breakfast buffet.

The 1st impression was walking into a market area,with lot many people crowding & loitering around the lobby area. Though the check-in is at 1400hrs, they were considerate enough to allot our double-room around 1100hrs (after a good 2hour wait in the lobby).  The room furnishings were all dated, the double-bed, the curtains,the carpets, the reading desk, the lamps, the closets etc, all called for urgent revamping to qualify as a 5star hotel. The most irritating feature was the electrical points - of the 3 plug-points provided in the room, only one of them worked.  Was a bit surprised & shocked to find the housekeeping staff enter our room using the master key, as early as 8.30am,"	Date of stay: October 2012

Ajit M	The hotel needs a renovation very badly.	I understand that the Galadari Hotel is among the oldest 5 star properties in Colombo.........it certainly looks like it and a renovation is badly required. The positives first;  1. Great location......is very close to the beach and the main shopping district. 2. The buffet spreads are amazing.......wide variety of veg and non veg delicacies with a live station for kebabs and steaks. 3. Very friendly staff......the doorman deserves a special mention.  The negatives;  1. The rooms are worse than a two star hotel. 2.The bed creaks and the basin leaks.  Final verdict - A rewamp of the rooms and i am sure most guests would rate this as an excellent hotel.	Date of stay: October 2012

Our manager booked ahead to ensure that we had sufficient beds in the rooms and that the hotel was suitable for our stay.  It was not.  This hotel is not 5 star, I would say 3 at best.  We were put in rooms with drilling going on above us at all hours of the day and when we complained to staff, they treated us with disrespect.  Room service entering our rooms without knocking, but then knocking at 3am with mistaken room service orders, overcharged laundry - it was a constant battle and not a relaxing holiday.  I would not stay here again.  In fact, the nicest part of our trip was when we took a tuk-tuk up the road to the Taj (Samudra?) and had )on more than one occasion) a meal at their lovely restaurant, where the"	Date of stay: September 2012

It is brilliantly located for matches at the R.Premadasa International Cricket Stadium, only 10 minutes by tuk tuk, and a two minute drive from Fort Railway Station.  The hotel lobby and reception is nicely laid out and we enjoyed drinks in the laid back atmosphere of the lobby bar. There are many places to enjoy food and drink and the hotel has a nice pool overlooking the beach. The room was nicely decorated but we found the bathroom needed a little attention in places but we had a very pleasant stay. We enjoyed our stay in the Galadari Hotel and would definitely recommend to others visiting Colombo."	Date of stay: October 2012

The room provided to me was of the fifth floor. I could make out that the hotel has aged now. But the rooms of the floors above level 8 were great and i guess newly renovated. The room service took their own time for things like ice, in dine service. The breakfast spread was good.   Comfort level was good. Overall it can be rated as good hotel but its ageing.

The accommodation was comfortable, have to say that, but so it should be for the price. The room was quite spacious and the view from it would have been nice if they had cleaned the windows. Swimming pool was refreshing but in full sun and a couple of umbrellas around the seating area wouldn't have come amiss.  The location is a bit on the boring side - I didn't know Colombo prior to this visit except for a scrutinise of the map - okay right next to the beach which is pleasant for a walk, but in the evening there are very few places to eat and drink nearby, after a very long ramble"	Date of stay: October 2012

We were greater very politely by the doorman but the reception was much less than warm and our experience elsewhere in Sri Lanka.  Trying to check in took ages and the staff appeared quite disgruntled. In fact an Indian gentleman next to us very politely asked a young female receptionist in an oversized jacket why she was being so rude.  The room was tatty, lamps on one side did not work and the electrical sockets appeared to be falling of the wall and looked quite dangerous.

But check-in was fairly quick. We got interconnected rooms but the AC in one room was not working. The staff fixed it but left some sharp objects behind which later hurt my husband's leg.

Beach is visible from the hotel room, you just need to cross the road.  Currently some renovation is going on hence be prepared for the noise of hammers and other construction work. Room size is standard, inetriors are old fashioned. Wash rooms are okay not great. Linens again are old. In need of desperate make over.

The room aircon was not working on the second day and the hotel staff changed our room. The mini bar was not stocked and not working. The glass was not cleaned for years together hence I couldn't  enjoy the lovely view. People walk-in and out and there is nobody to question. I sometimes think there is no security in the hotel.

The side of the pool was even being painted whilst we were swimming in the pool!  The breakfast buffet was ok, decent choice and reasonable quality, but on most occasions i had to wait 10 minutes for the pot of tea i ordered.

There is jackhammers all day, some rooms are 1 star.Having stayed for a week and then returned,unfortunately, I was guarrenteed on check in the jackhammers had stopped, only to find within 10 minutes it was not true. The manger who promised me this was then not game enough to come out of his office to talk to me. This is an awfully hotel, if you can have a choice stay elsewhere."	Date of stay: August 2012
mysvar	High Tea at the Galadari	"Walked in today for the High Tea. It is appalling to what level the hotel has fallen. My visit was after a very long time. Stewards dragging vacuum cleaners, trolleys loaded with buckets, cleaning materials right past tables where guests are eating. Food service was horrible. Waiters giggling when guests serve the food. Pasta icy cold (why pasta at high tea!!!), oil dripping from spring rolls and mini kievs. Cakes dry, and girl doing waffles and pancakes looked bored out of her skull. No assistance even with sauces which accompanied waffles and pancakes.Supervisor was very nice and listened to my complaints. Five cashiers at entrance to coffee shop having a major loud conversation irrespective of guests nearby at the top of their voices. Is there a manager in this hotel or even"	Date of stay: August 2012

Bar always shut before time, poor quality room service food. Disgusting and dirty room, absolutely filthy, peeling wallpaper dirty bathroom even after house keeping has been, poor attention to detail. worst hotel i ever stayed in. i have to spend another 6 weeks in colombo but it wont be at the Galadari."

Harry Lime	Everything just worked...	"I recently had the pleasure of staying in one of the Galadari's presidential floor rooms on a business/leisure trip.  The hotel's location is spot on for both business and leisure travellers and my room was spacious, clean, and had a stunning view over the sea.  The Galadari isn't the most modern hotel, but everything just works, which is more than can be said about many other places I stayed in. From the staff, all friendly and quick to assist, to the room with a proper work desk, comfortable chair, and stable high-speed Internet (not free, but reasonably priced), and the business centre.  I certainly enjoyed my stay and hope to be back one day."	Date of stay: August 2012
7947	Very good location and value for money	The hotel is at Galle Face Green and a prime location very close to World Trade Centre Colombo. I stayed in a renowated room and the room is quite fine. Definitely value for money with good sea view. Certain floors were under renovation but no inconvenience to me. B/fast spread was good with Indian corner.	Date of stay: July 2012
Troas	Food amazing	"Had a birthday party for grandson, we did not stipulate the type of food, when it arrived it was a fantastic mixture of all national foods. Mini steak and kidney pies, pizza, cakes and plenty of fruit juices and carbonated drinks as well as many varieties of fruit. The staff were friendly and very smart dress wise. Later we swam in the pool, wonderfully clean he had a fantastic time with many of our family. We had booked the hotel just for the party as we were actually staying with family in Colombo."

Zaufyshan H	Retro Looking Hotel for Muslim Travelers	"It is a great concern amongst Muslim families to stay in a hotel that is in-tune with their value systems. Galadari hotel promises that and more. The service from the staff is polite and courteous.  The hotel is an older property so does not have the new look, but the rooms are spacious and comfortable. It is located a stone throw away from the sea and morning walks are the best as the city is awakening for a brand new day. The Buffet has a varied choice of local and continental food. Tours should be arranged through the concierge as the touts can be a rip off.   Good luck!"	Date of stay: September 2011

Aneera S	Great Experience	"We stayed here as part of a package with the Srilankan Airlines for a day. We were on transit and our stay was in this hotel. I loved the hotel. So neat and clean as well as well built. Went to visit the Ganga Rama temple from here in a Rikshaw, it wasn't too far either. I was told its a 5 start hotel, but I am not sure about that. The food was good, near our taste too. Plus, every meal was free for us. Dinner and Breakfast fell during our stay there.  just one mishap, our locker got stuck and i had to call in help. they took a lot of time to fix that while i kept fretting that our passports were inside."

Sanjaya Wijeyekoon	Functional	"Marginally cheaper than the other hotels in region but covers all the bases quite well. I have found them to be quite accommodating for last minute bookings, quite good facilities, bars, restaurant and one of the better and popular in house night clubs ( if you are into this of course), swimming pool and gym. The room views facing south towards the old parliament building and Galle Face green are very nice. Usually my 3rd choice in Colombo after the Galle Face hotel and Cinnamon Grand, when the others are overbooked or overpriced! Functional hotel but not bad at all for what you pay."

SugarRush77	Stayed for one night during the “Colombo Night Races”...	"The hotel was centrally located by the track during Colombo’s first “Night Race”. As such, the hotel had attracted possibly their highest volume guests in a long time! They had a private corporate function which was part of the Colombo Night Race, their in-house guests most of whom like us, had checked in just for the race, and also guests were dining at their restaurants during the race and the staff just couldn’t cope. They all looked absolutely annoyed and frustrated.  We checked in the afternoon (around 3pm), the room was small and old but clean. It had a TV with local and international channels and provision for internet connectivity.   We ordered room service and it took over an hour and a half to arrive. We went to the restaurant for a late dinner, and it was absolutely"	Date of stay: December 2011
Rhian M	Not 5*	"Having spent a few lovely days in Kandy in a beautiful (and cheap) guest house we were looking forward to some 5* luxury in Colombo. The Galadari is certainly nowhere near 5*, even by Sri Lankan standards. Our 1st room had no hot water, the tv didn't work and the shower curtain looked like it had been there since the 80's. The inernet access is expensive and really slow. The staff spoke very little English and did not followup any minor complaints. The only saving grace was the beautiful view of the sea."

TedsterNorwich	Outdated!!	"This would have been an amazing hotel about 30 years ago! Lobby is still fairly grand but the corridors and rooms are tatty bordering on dirty.

Would prefer Galle Face, Cinnamon Grand, Hilton etc"	Date of stay: April 2012
Nivriti L	Dilapidated and Overpriced	"stayed here for 1 night in April.  The hotel charges 5 star rates but gives you a 3 star experience and without breakfast! Rooms are old and jaded with peeling wall paper and stained bathrooms. Even the bed covers are faded and dirty. Another thing to be warned about and which I experienced for the first time, the hotel charges you an exhorbitant refundable security deposit at the time of checking in. I was charged LKR 40,000 for a double room. I really do not understand the point of doing this. Location wise, it's great. Next to the World Trade Center and Dutch Hospital and about 5 minutes from the clubs. The swimming pool is brilliant, overlooking the old parliament building, Galle face greens and the Indian ocean. it is only slightly disconcerting that all the rooms that you"	Date of stay: April 2012
Lauraj_1287	Better than expected	"I had read many of the reviews on here about the Galadari and went in worried about the hotel. On checking in, everything went well and we went to our room. It was clear that the hotel could do with some renovations but everything was clean and in working order so no complaints.  We received a call in our room to offer us an upgrade to a presidential suite that was free. This was obviously the highlight of our stay but it seems that the hotel does try to provide you with the best room available at the time.  I enjoyed the breakfast buffet, and I think it had the best selection of all the buffets we have had on our trip around Sri Lanka. Room service menu was very extensive and very well priced. Service was great.  I used the hair and beauty salon, Ramzi's, which was recommended"	Date of stay: April 2012

NEDHK	5 star hotel with 3 star service	"Galadari Hotel in Colombo Sri Lanka is a run down former 5 star hotel that on its best day can reach 3 stars. The non smoking room had ash trays and smelled of smoke. The breakfast was rich but very unhygienic, the juice was delivered in old plastic buckets and pored into its containers. The waiters handled food with their bare hands … For the price paid, 159USD/night, you can do better."	Date of stay: February 2012

emma s	wonderfull experience.	"we stayed at galadari  in jan , we were upgraded to executive floor, visually this hotel is beautifull,also the service and politeness of the staff was very good. I ENJOYED THE BREAKFAST BUFFET.every type of food is served and the quality is great. We had a late nite flight on our check out date , but the lady at the reception was kind enough to let us check out late instead of 12 pm. so we wouldnt have to be checked out with no place to go ,.untill time for the airport. I was very impressed, there customer service is impeccabel.  this hotel is very enjoyable and close to city center. california grill upstairs is also very very  good.One of the best hotels in colombo. thank u galadari for a very enjoyable stay."

X-O75	Good location but outdated hotel	This hotel is very well located by the sea in Colombo. There is a very nice walk beside the sea where people have foods and rests. Interesting! The hotel itself is getting old and low level of confort since most of furniture and bed should be changed now. The hotel is clean and the room are big with a nice sea view but it does not work anymore... The food at the buffet restaurant for lunch was nice with a good diversity.	Date of stay: January 2012

Sundeep_Soni	A substandard 5* - rating 5 on 10	"Rooms - old rooms, ancient TV, size is OK.  Bathroom - it took the housekeeping 1 hour to repair a fault in the bathtub. More to this, they came after an hour of followup with the reception and housekeeping.  Buffet - Decent breakfast. Dinner was OK as they did not had any Indian chapati or naan, even though they had dal fry, paneer and other Indian curries.  Reception - Funniest of all, they did not have any hotel info brochure and the receptionist said that they will e-mail me a copy if I want to refer.   Wifi - They charge 5 USD per hour of WiFi.  Location - only positive was the prime location near the beach road and the old parliament. But the receptionist advised me not to go to the beach road in the evening as it is not ""safe"". So we ended up sitting in the hotel for the"	Date of stay: January 2012
JohnPaul2010	Nice location needing refurbishment	"We spent 2 nights at Galadari Hotel during a private tour (selected by our travel agency, last week of December 2011). Galadari is ideally located in the Colombo security area, in front of old parliament and at the beginning of the famous Galle Face Walk. The hotel is supposed to be a 5*-hotel by local standards, which are quite different from South-East Asia standards. Hotel owners should really plan a comprehensive refurbishment.  We appreciated to have 2 connecting rooms with sufficient space. But hotel rooms are old and not sound-proof (other customers or staff talking in the corridor woke me up in the middle of the night). The swimming pool is OK with a nice view on the ocean. Hotel Staff are generally nice and helpful (exception: a housekeeping man came into our kids' room"	Date of stay: December 2011

The hotel is really old & not well sound proofed room . i paid nearly 170 us$ for one night. not good value for the price but good location though. the Hotel management need to seriously think to renovate the hotel. at the moment if you can get a room from this hotel 100 us$ per night that will be worthy considering the location,"	Date of stay: February 2011
amirali10	Old is NOT gold in the case of Galadari	"Although its location is excellent, but it seems like they have not refurbished the hotel since the 80's.  Rooms are really worn out and look more like a 2/3 star hotel rooms.  Dirty carpet, CRT type TV's, rooms stinking with cigarette smoke etc.  Perhaps the only positive was the amazing beach view from the room.  For $ 200 / night it is a rip off.  No complaints about the service though, amazing breakfast and lunch at the coffee shop.  Will definitely not stay at this hotel again unless they do a major renovation."	Date of stay: January 2012
Manish A	You can see the wrinkles!	"We were put up in this hotel by Srilankan Airlines due to their incompetency in operating flights on time. The stay was for one whole day (14hrs) out of which initial hours in morning were meant to catch up with sleep. Hoping for the best, we were transported to Galadari from the airport. This hotel is in Colombo city and it took us about 2 hrs to get there. A sleepless night and this travel made us more frustrated. However, the hotel was quite attractive at the first sight. It was Christmas time and the lobby of the hotel was ""over"" decorated with trees, lights, etc etc. After checking into the room (our request for higher floor was completely ignored and we did not have patience to discuss it further), we were slightly shocked. For a 5 star rating, the carpet on the entire"	Date of stay: December 2011

pradeep m	Old but not really gold !	"Galadari, is probably a property selling more of its location than anything else. We were on a refurbished room in the 7th floor so rooms was pretty good with a great view of sea. If you are not specifically very picky about service/quality/food etc the hotel works perfectly as a average functional place to be. Breakfast spread is elaborate , food quality is ok and service at the restaurant is pretty good. Decor is tad old fashioned and overall the hotel makes you feel a bit clumsy with loads of people , over done up interiors and a bit old fashioned in service delivery.   I would reccomend to walk in with expectations of a 3 star and treat Galadari more as a functional property as opposed to a luxury. For the price you pay there are better hotels in Colombo to go to."

AngmohofArabia	not even 4*	"There are only 2 positive aspects in regards to the Galadari; its location (opposite the parlament and along the beginning of Galle Road facing the sea) and its very good food.  Requested for a high floor quiet room; my request was ignored and was given a low floor room facing the main road. Tired looking room with 70's rattan furniture and a rather shabby bathroom. Aircon was set at 25 degrees and could not be changed. No proper quily, just a coversheet and a brown blanket.  Overall a 3+* hotel who does not provide enough for what they charge."

Bathrooms are spacious and clean. Their room clean service is quite good, they tend to do it twice a day. I would quite definitely love to go over here again.  The live band is quite nice and has a really good pub inside the hotel if not mistaken margarita blue.

Irritations: One comes to such five star hotels expecting a class among the guests. Unfortunately it was not so. Though I have no grudge against others, letting out the rooms to tour parties comprising of first timers to five star hotels does put the hotel in a somewhat dim light.

On the downside, the age of the hotel is showing. On the upside, the rooms are the largest I've seen in Colombo and a good number of them come with an excellent sea-view. The higher your room is, the better the sea -view. Service is pretty good and has been consistent over the years. Reasonably large spread for the breakfast buffet as well and room-service is pretty good too.   On the whole a very decent option in what's increasingly becoming an expensive city."

We check into the rooms and voila, the carpet looks like a crime feels absolutely gruesome to step on, no bedroom slippers provided. The TV is from the 80s. The couch smells like evidence from an episode of CSI, and the bedlinen was grimy and felt like it had been washed in the ocean outside. To top off our experience, power goes out for a couple of hours midday without backup - no air-conditioning in sweltering Colombo.

Pixy76	Never again -  I cahnged the hotel afer 1 night.	"Don't do the same mistake I did!  -->I booked this hotel based on recommendations form other travelers and as there were some good reports as well as some bad I decided for this hotel because of the location and also because of the rate. Info: all hotels in Colombo has minimum rate which is ca 184 USD total. You can get Hilton for 210 USD (!), or a Cinnamon  for the same rate.  The hotel is truly outdated - rooms smells bad, the furniture is in bad condition and when i arrived they made me wait outside the room because they were doping some maintenance in the bathroom. The Spa center is a small room, looks as a storage room with a massage table inside. Terrible.  Room service staff was annoying - they wanted to collect the tray late in the evening and didn't leave the door. I"	Date of stay: May 2011
TedBuis	good hotel but  needs refurbishment	"Overall quality of the hotel is fine. Location is convinient. Nothing really great, nothing to complain. Room was little outdated and needs to be refurbished. Restaurant offers good breakfast but the diner buffet offers not much besides sri lanka dishes."	Date of stay: April 2011
chicksfly000	This hotel reeks of faded and forgotten glory	"The best thing about this place is it's location; a block to the water in one direction, stores and restaurants a block in the other.   You can walk to a lot of the interesting things in town.   And right next door is a very good hotel with excellent restaurant and bar.  The rooms are old and tired.  The staff does it's job and nothing more.  The restaurants don't open til 7.  We went to the travel agency in the building to get a guide and driver for the day and I think they just pulled in a cab from the street; he wasn't very good.   But the breakfast buffet is large and interesting.  There must be better places at that price."	Date of stay: February 2011
mdorana	3 star and dirty at best...don't waste your money here	"My husband and I stayed here for one night at the beginning of our Sri Lanka tour, and it was more than enough. The hotel is VERY dated and nothing close to a 5 star rating. The hallways leading to rooms are lined with wallpaper, literally peeling away from the wall and carpets full of stains. The rooms itself was just as bad. Odd smell, stains on carpet and wall. Bathroom was also stained and while trying to take a shower the hot water knob completely fell off. It took two calls to maintenance for someone to finally come up and fix it. Noise was also a problem as we had to listen to our neighbor’s TV the entire night. This is not a five start hotel and they shouldn't claim to be. False advertising for sure.   I would strongly suggest that you choose to stay elsewhere."	Date of stay: March 2011

HiruniG	Absolutely horrible - would never go back again!!	"This place was for the lack of a better word crap. (1) we booked online, and the website said the price was $140 USD per night, for the room on the ""Executive"" Floor. When we checked in, we were told that the $140USD is only for one person and there was an additional fee payable per night. We ended up paying $190 USD per night. It didn't matter that we booked for 2 guests on the website and that it didn't change the price when we booked online. (2) The supposed Executive rooms were absolutely out dated and clearly not maintained. The bathrooms were old, the carpets were old and the room had a funny smell. (3) The Executive rooms came with breakfast on the Executive floor. Which was absolutely useless. They had (clearly powder) runny eggs, beans and sausages. And the downstairs"	Date of stay: March 2011
magdak13	Certainly not a Five star hotel	"We stayed 4 night in this hotel and found very disapointing. The rooms are very dated with wallpaper falling from the walls, derty and dated bathrooms. Didn't like the quality of the breakfast. When we complained about the room the finally upgraded us to the executive floor but the rooms are exactly the same. The only plus was that we could have our breakfast on the floor which was better than the very noisy breakfast restaurant downstairs. During the weekend we found out that our room was under the party room on the top floor and had to enjoy the heavy music till midnight."	Date of stay: March 2011

PuriW	Dont stay unless you want to get ripped off	we did the reservation through the hotel online facility. but when we checked in they gave us a different amount. Said that  they charge extra for online bookings even though I went through the hotel web site. Things got worse when I tried to check out. The hotel said that the deposit I made through online is not deducted from the final amount as that amount is charged by the web site. The reception and the manger in-charge had no idea what they were talking about. In the end I had to pay $190 for a room which I booked only for $140. rooms are very average for that amount. I could have stayed at a 5 start hotel for that price in Colombo. Even though I specifically asked for a non-smoking room they put my self and my wife into a smoking room which was filthy and had very bad	Date of stay: March 2011
hits_109	Above Average	Hotel Galadari has an awesome location with rooms overlooking the Indian ocean. The rooms are of average size and you can feel that it is an old five star hotel. But all the facilities are provided. The room has a well stocked minibar. The breakfast is elaborate and definitely a king size feast. ts location is pretty central to most of the happening places in Colombo and hence an ideal place to stay. The service is good as you would expect in any 5 star.	Date of stay: February 2011

My mom and sis shared one room while i took another.  The rooms look really old, so did my huge bed, the linen looked old but clean, and very comfy i slept like a baby, the bathroom was really small, also really old but really really clean.  My mom and sis also confirmed that there room was the same, they had two single beds (also very old but very comfy... lol) so in other words, you get an old but clean and comfy room :) The next day we saw that the hotel was super busy, lots"	Date of stay: December 2010

The hotel is not the most modern property that one could find in Colombo, however it is by far the best in terms of Staff and Service.. i have stayed in other 5 star properties in Colombo, however, i must say that the service is what will make me come back for more... I did not have any major crisis that the hotel handled exceptionally well, but they say that it’s the little things in life that make you keep wanting more.. So my experience was wonderful, the service was wonderful and of course the view from the hotel was wonderful.

UdSe	Good but needs refurbishment	The reception of the Galadari was very busy but despite all the staff was very helpful and pleasant. Check in was bit slow but it did not matter much. Even though the rooms were basic 5 star rooms they were clean and well tidied. The toilets were well equipped. But the rooms need serious refurbishment.  Basic facilities were provided and the housekeeping staff was very friendly and they issued everything we wanted. The restaurants were alright and the menu was well selected. The food was delicious and they also offered a variety of juices. Another drawback was that the elevators were very slow and we had to wait minutes waiting for one. Other than those few problems we faced during our stay the hotel was good.	Date of stay: November 2010

Very surprised at some of the glowing reviews of this hotel which, I suspec,t are given by ""locals"" Hotel undergoing construction and is badly in need of updating and refurbishment. Obviously a higher standard originally, the rooms and equipment are tired at best, scruffy and broken at worst. The one redeeming  factor was the breakfast which was ample with plenty of choice. For the price, however, it was still poor value for money given the state of the hotel overall."	Date of stay: December 2010

Hotel is located just across the beach and the rooms we have stayed (on 11 th Floor) have an amazing views of the sea. But rooms are bit dated. Very clean & functional bathroom though. Hotel staff are incredibly helpful. Great Breakfast and variety of food served (Srilankan, Indain, Continental) are impressive. I particularly liked the Gym! It has a clear sea view and enjoyed my workout. Helpful & Knowledgeable staff @ Gym as well. Hotel is in city centre and close to many attractions. Free transport to Casino's is a Bonus!! Hotel gave us early Check-in (5am) and late checkout (4pm) and it was a big help. Will definitely stay here, if I go to Colombo again."	Date of stay: October 2010

If you like to see the sea and walk in the beach the best areas to stay are Colombo 1 and 3.  In general speaking the hotel is good for a short stay. Average swimming pool but tatty gym and rooms. The phone, TV set and other appliances in the room are several years old.  Food is also average. I didn't like some attitudes from the staff, like a stood bellboy waiting inside your room for a tip or housekeeping replacing unused shampoo and soaps on daily basis. For me, it seemed that the staff takes unused soap for their own personal use. Then, there are several signs advising you about security and to do not leave valuable items inside the"	Date of stay: April 2010

Rate wise, can't commend too much since I don't know the city standard, but seems ok to me, not to ex, not a bargain buy. Lobby is just so & so, nothing to shout about, as compared to the rooms. Booked by company so I guessed this hotel must be ok or above average."	Date of stay: September 2009
nbaman99	Very nice hotel	"We spent the 3rd week of our Sri Lanka trip at this hotel. Having spent the first week at Taj, I had high expectations for this one and almost all of my expectations came true.  The only two bad things for me is the location and buffet service. Don’t get me wrong, all the rooms facing the ocean are a very nice touch, but because the hotel right next to the old parliament, you are not permitted to open or look trough the windows. I must add here that, the situation in Sri Lanka much calmer now so the rules may have changed. The buffer service was good, but comparing to taj this is ok. Almost same kind of food was offered the entire week and they keep count on ho many people eat at the buffet, where at Taj you can just walk in and eat free without anyone keeping count.

potties	Not 5 star but very friendly	The good things are the staff and the excellent quality breakfast with a very wide selection of foods. The bad are that the whole place is in desperate need of a refurb....water dripping through ceiling in one area and my bathroom had mold probably due to the air con being on continously. There is no free internet usage which doesnt comparte well with other places in the world these days. On the whole I think I would advise that you look somewhere else to stay until the place is upgraded...a shame.	Date of stay: March 2010

It had various different cuisine restaurants (i guess total 5) and bar. Breakfast included the Indian dishes also. It had an open swimming pool which I did not like much. We went to the sea just in front of the hotel and enjoyed the sun set. Walking along the seashore is fun with beautiful horizon. Since it is near to the presidential house, the security is very tight in this locality, but it is totally peaceful."	Date of stay: November 2009
tripheid	Galadari Colombo - best avoided	"I booked into this place for 3 nights. There is an irony on turning on the tv in the room as you are met with a promo video extolling the 5 star luxury of the hotel. This place is not worthy of that description and not worth the cash paid.  The room I was given was grotty and tatty and looks like it hasn't been modernised since the early 80s. Some electrical cables don't look safely wired. The strip light in the bathroom makes a loud humming noise. The phone in the room is antiquated. I asked for another room but since the corridors are similarly in need of refurb, I wasn't optimistic I would be given anything better. Sure enough the same issues were in the other room. Also the internet access ($15 US extra per day) didn't work and needed me to ring reception to ask for someone"	Date of stay: December 2009

As mentioned, the rooms could be updated to be equivalent of a five star hotel (such as minor items as cracked tiles in the bathtub) - but on the other hand, the rooms were spotless clean, had great views of the Indian ocean and Colombo, comfortable beds, 24 hour hot water (wasn't working for brief period when I was there the first time), and I considered their included (free) breakfast to be wonderful with an Indian buffet, a Sri Lankan buffet, and a European buffet.

Our dining expereince otherwise in other outlets was also good.  The leisure club was reasonably equipped.  The hotel was located in a top security zone which was good but a disadvantage from tourist point of view as there was not much to see at walking distance.  Sri Lankan people were very friendly and spoke reasonably good english.  Overall a nice place to stay.	Date of stay: October 2009
A Tripadvisor Member	Worth every penny...	"The one thing that really surprised us about Galadari, is how reasonable it was. For just a few dollars more than the 2-3 star hotels , it was worth every penny spent.  Rooms were fairly good, breakfast was amazing (huge spread, and a fairly good vegetarian choice as well - something we could barely say about any other place we saw around Sri Lanka).  Location was also pretty good - by the sea.  Not as fancy as the other 5 star deluxe hotels, but considering our budget, Galadari definitely exceeded our expectations."	Date of stay: October 2009
A Tripadvisor Member	My stay in Galadari	"The room in Galadari is excellent, clean and newish, mine had a sea view, not sure if they all do.  The bar was very reasonably priced with good live music, also if you are in the mood there is a busy disco later on.  The buffet breakfast was great, if you need some good food in Colombo here is a great start.  I found the galle face area of Colombo better then this area and prefer to stay there.  Also the Internet is very expensive at $15 per day, but I work on the internet so had to pay.  Also soft drinks in the restaurant are overpriced."	Date of stay: October 2009

A Tripadvisor Member	An Experience Worthawhile	This Hotel makes a worth while stay for a transit passenger. Spacious rooms and a good supply of toiletries. Complimentary water and coffee was also an added attraction. The icing of the stay was the buffet breakfast. The huge spread made it difficult for a choice. Finally you ended up all stuffed with a heavy breakfast. Also a very considerate place for a late check out.	Date of stay: August 2009

It is not anymore, it is a little dated here and there. We got room 821, which with it's two queen size beds was a perfect fit for us with our two small children. The room showed signs of being old, it was not in perfect condition anymore. But it gave us two nights of very comfortable sleep. The breakfast was good with a reasonable selection and quality food. One night we also did the buffet dinner in the main restaurant and was pleasantly surprised. It did not have the presentation and atmosphere of a true five star hotel. As I'm a little fed up with local food I stayed to the continental food which was of very high quality. Not far behind Hilton where we did the buffet"	Date of stay: August 2009

In 20 years that I've been going to Colombo, the Galadari has been my worst ever experience. I will definitely never go back.

ChennaiSolo	Average Hotel For a 5Star	"When I booked in Galadari during a two day stop over in Srilanka, the agent told me it was a 5 Star hotel due to which I dint probe further. This was a decision which I really regretted later especially because I had an option to book in Taj property and actually let it go because of few thousands and assumed both are 5 Star and should be same. I cant wonder how Galdari was also given 5 Star. First of all the rooms were looking so old and in some places it was stinking. The toilets too are the same thing. The worst point is the hotel is just behind the Srilankan president house and you can forget about any casual stroll in the evenings or so on. Best is to avoid staying in this hotel. Even the service and food were of very average quality and too expensive."	Date of stay: May 2008

The swimming pool on the first floor terrace offer a relaxed sun tanning and a lovely sea view, With excellent restaurants."	Date of stay: November 2008

A Tripadvisor Member	Not a great choice	"Galadari is affordable but tatty and sleazy. Location is big drawback, unless you have business in the downtown Fort area. Staying further south near Galle Face Green is more pleasant. I don't recommend this hotel unless the location is useful."	Date of stay: March 2009
A Tripadvisor Member	Nice view	"This hotel is quite old and located in the heart of the city.  So there are lots of security checks before getting into the hotel.  The rooms are acceptable for an old hotel but my room at a very good view of the sea (maybe not for all rooms).  Overall, a pleasent stay in Colombo."	Date of stay: January 2009
Krungsri	Value for money	"Very good value for money. All staff were very courteous and efficient. There was a small problem (no hot water in shower) that was fixed immediately and a small oversight (no beer/wine in mini-bar) that we didn't worry much about and was attended to later. The women's sauna wasn't working when we were there. The security between the hotel and the presidential ofices could be a little oppressive for some people when official functions/meetings are on, but at least you know you're in a safe area. The hotel is not perfect, but the aircon worked, breakfasts were fine, there was a very nice buffet in the coffee shop at lunch,and transfers were efficient. Above all, the staff were all very nice and helpful. So,unless there was a significant price hike I would definitely stay at the"	Date of stay: December 2008
Shokan77	Hotel with lots of potential but a little frayed around the edges	"We enjoyed our stay at the Galadari Hotel and found it to be good value for money. The staff were unfailingly courteous and obliging and the art deco lobby decked out in glittering christmas decorations was impressive to see. Admittedly the hotel is looking a little tired and needs a renovation but it is spotlessly clean, the rooms are spacious and the food - though a little lacking in flavour sometimes is plentiful and cleanly prepared. The chief downside is something that is completely beyond the Galadari's control - due to the political situation and the fact that the central business district is a prime LTTE target, the Galadari, along with the Intercontinental, the Hilton and the Taj Samudra is sectioned in a high security zone which is patrolled by the army and requires"	Date of stay: December 2008
Uduwerage	Marred an otherwise pleasant visit to Colombo	"The Galadari Hotel has noticeably deteriorated over the past few years.  Physically it is getting rather tired, with the rooms requiring updating. Generally I stay on the 12th Floor, being the Business floor with the separate Executive Business Lounge.  With the exception of the young man that regularly looks after the Executive Business Lounge, and a particularly helpful porter, my most recent visit was marred by the unsatisfactory behaviour of the reception staff, who in their wisdom chose to put me in a room other than that which I had booked, and at a higher rate than had been agreed. They then chose to imply that my memory of the telephone conversation that I had had with them was faulty when making the reservation the day before.  When I eventually was given a room on the"	Date of stay: November 2008
Warren F	Excellent experience...great value for money	"Stayed at this hotel with my-inlaws when we were visiting Sri Lanka...We were given two adjoining rooms. The hotel is first class..Rooms very spacious, clean, breafast buffet excellent, has all facilities expected of a five star hotel...pool, gym, spa.  We used at as a stopover as we were in Colombo to do some shopping.   Highly recommend it for the price. Would definetly stay here again soon."	Date of stay: October 2007
Hamstring	Perfect for short stay in Colombo	"We stayed in the Galadari for 1 night at the start of our 2 week holiday in Sri Lanka. The hotel is located in central Colombo directly across from the Presidential palace and therefore in the centre of a big security cordon.   The room was quite large and was well appointed with a very comfortable bed, nice bathroom etc. As other contributors point out it probably could do with a makeover at this stage but as we only stayed for 1 night we didn't mind.   The cafe bar, where we dined & had breakfast was a nice bright area with a water feature. The food buffet was very nice with a large selection on the night we stayed and breakfast also offered a lot of choice.  There are a couple of shops, a hair salon and a bar on the ground floor and a pool & tennis court on the 1st.  All in"	Date of stay: September 2008
travellerguy	Good overnight stop  hotel in Colombo City	"Galadari  Hotel Colombo  Stayed at this Colombo city centre hotel for the second time as a stopover on way to the airport, so thought i would give a little insight into it.  Location: Right in middle of high security zone, so be prepared for the extra security that this entails, not in my opinion too intrusive, but will stop you for instance from taking photos of surrounding area and sea front. 45 minutes from airport.  Rooms: Good sized, and clean, but maybe  a  make   over is now due, some are showing their age, none the less good rooms, recommended to request rooms on upper floors, due to noise from street traffic and Karaoke Bar on first floor.  But overall good for a one or two night stay, complimentary tea/coffee making facilities in rooms.  Internet access available if"	Date of stay: August 2008
Neil Doody	Excellent location and facilities	"From minute one a wonderful experience.  This started at the airport where the Galadari has its own dedicated meet and greet desk.  They will organise a taxi to hotel for $18 or 2,000 SLR.  Our room was massive which was good as 3 of us were sharing. Still plenty of room.  5 minutes to all types of shops if you walk via the SL version of twin towers WTC which is next door.  The WTC being located next door makes this hotel extremely safe.    Food was exceptional with a good variation of european and asian choice.   Good pool, gym and tennis courts.  Highlight - the staff. Lowlight - Colombo air polution, which is not too bad around theb Galadari."	Date of stay: December 2007
Princess-Yas			
Oregonzied	A little rough around the edges	The Galadari is starting to show its age. I had a difficult time getting my room assigned. It took four visits to rooms to find one that did not have someone else already staying in it or not made up or other problems. The staff seemed bored by their jobs. The breakfast was pretty lackluster. The hotel car service was very overpriced -- double the price of local taxi service. The proximity to secretariat building and army base causes traffic and access disruptions when officials are on the move.  I will stay elsewhere on my next visit.	Date of stay: September 2007
Moghamis	It is the mean of bad word !!	"We stayed one night in this hotel. It was very bad, I sorry for that but that is the fact. The room and bathroom are cleanless and the furniture are very old. There are a tag on the room door for Makkah direction for Muslim prayers but when I checked the direction I found that is wrong direction!!!; I dont know why dont making sure for this issue this is critical issue for Muslims. The resturent was limited foods and not carefully services. The swiming pool is small and not clean. You can not take a picture from your room or the area around the hotel because security causes. Happy to stay in Sri Lanka but not in this hotel.  Eng. A.Moghamis Riyadh"	Date of stay: August 2007
rgilbert	In desperate need of refurbishment	The lobby seemed ok but apart from that the hotel is in a poor state and is shabby.  We only stayed for one night as we were flying out the next day.  If we had been staying any longer I would have checked out and into another hotel.  We were so tired when arriving that we ordered room service so cannot comment on the restauraunt.  Room service food was not too bad.  I would not consider the hotel to be 4 stars and I would be generous saying that it was 3 star.	Date of stay: November 2006
PescaraGina	dishonesty and need renovation	"We just came back form Colombo, where we staid one night in Galadary hotel. Only breakfast restaurant and lobby could be saved. The rest needs very urgent renovation and for sure is not a 5* hotel!!! Room was humid and stinky! Stuff and the reception was not efficiant and we had a lot of difficulties to get a taxi to the airport. And the night before we where cheated by the tuc-tuc driver booked by the portier at the hotel. For sure we will never come back to this hotel and I suggest other travelers to be very carefull booking this hotel.  Lina"	Date of stay: March 2007
Sahana S	Needs some renovation	"The location of Galadari is good. We got a beach facing room on 8th floor of the hotel on request. The room was really clean and spacious, however the bathrooms required some renovation. The service is really not upto the mark. Security around the hotel was beefed up as it is closer to the President's residence. Limited menu at the Chinese restaurant - Stix. Sheherazade - Arabian Restaurant had no options for veggies.  Coffee shop served south indian breakfast with other options as well."	Date of stay: January 2007
NeilMnM	Dated and shabby	"I stayed here in early August, fortunately for just one day.  The lobby is firmly stuck in the seventies and quite franklyy the hotel looks like it hasnt been touched for 30 years.  My room was shabby though a decent size, whilst the bathroom had a cracked basin plinth.  This is comfortably the poorest quality hotel I have stayed in in Colombo.  It urgently needs complete refurbishment."	Date of stay: August 2006
Rana786005	Dishonesty	We came back for month before to Pakistan. I stayed at this hotel and i have lots of complaines. First of  all night club is only for the couples. Seconds room services is rubished. Tv Channels are limited and service is not well. In Bathroom no  muslim shawer. In the end when i time of check out hotel made bill for US $460 and now i received a bill of my credit card hotel managment deduct US $490 plus i have not use any kind of thing in mini bar but they deducted 1000 lkr  too (Terrible). They think that a person who never comes again so do what they  want.  One more thing i see two three cities  of srilanka like kandy i paid  some extra charges in the shape of  taxes.I go in elephent zoo normaly for lankans ticket prize is 25lkr and for forgiener 500lkr this redicluse.Every	Date of stay: June 2006
Wanderer32920	"Good hotel with decent facilities, but the service is not really worth 5-stars"	"This was a 5-star hotel located right in front of Galle-Face, the ocean-front park that Sri Lankans heavily used in the evening.  The hotel had nice rooms, with views of the oceans, and had a varieties of restaurants.  It had non-air-conditioned gym, and an acceptable pool on a deck with a view of the ocean.  The service at this hotel was somewhat unfriendly --- this is in comparison to the hotels outside of Colombo.  The staffs really left us fending for ourselves, i.e., we really needed to push for something that we needed --- an unexpected in a 5-star hotel.    The breakfast selections at this hotel were the poorest out of the 4 hotels we stayed in Sri Lanka (Taj Airport, Amaya Lake, Mahawelli Reach, and the Galadari) --- not much was worth eating.  Being so close to Colombo,"	Date of stay: April 2006
Indiababe	Nice hotel	Staff friendly and for the most part efficient. They managed to sort out the problem of the safe not opening in our room very quickly. Clean and spacious rooms. Good buffet food. Nice pool. Would stay here again. Superior rooms are notably better than stand rooms.	Date of stay: April 2005
darjohn	It was Wonderful!!	"In the heart of the business area, but soo nice! I was on the 10th floor with a view of the ocean. Service was the best! Food in all cafes was the best.The Califorina on the top floor was 5 star. I had a frend for dinner and told the staff, they made it even better!Thanks Clive DeCosta for a wonderful evening!!I miss the Galadari, there are no hotels like this in the USA And no service like Galadari style !Again Thanks!! Also! when you fly into Colombo use the hotels car pickup! 18.00 US to the hotel, much nicer than taxi!"	Date of stay: October 2005
ssz	Galadari	"This hotel is definitely not 5 star.  The staff was very nice and helpful but very very slow with providing service.  The rooms have a really nice view of the ocean, however are rather dingy.  Also, I found a cockroach in my bathroom one morning, which would explain the constant smell of roach repellant in the halls.  Their are likely better options in Colombo such as the Taj or the Hilton.  Both of which you can find good rates if you shop the net."	Date of stay: September 2005
Marbellasiv	Unfortunate......	"Have stayed at this hotel previously and had no complaints, but I understand there has been a change in the management and boy, did it show!  The first room I was shown to was mouldy, damp and dirty! When I was eventually given another room, which was lacking the mould and damp but still dirty, no apology was made and I was made to feel a burdon! Being Sri Lankan, I'm would hate to think that this is the level of service this hotel will now provide.  I will definitely NOT be staying here again, and will be recommending the same to all friends and family."	Date of stay: July 2005
wantaword	Not bad	"Stayed here for a few nights. On the upside staff are very helpful and friendly and the location is great, overlooking the ocean and some lovely older buildings (if you are on the better side) - but on the downside the room was very dirty (carpet is in desparate need of a steam clean and the attention to detailed cleaning throughout just wasn't there) - the room needed a complete scrubbing down.  That said the bedding at least was clean/fresh"	Date of stay: June 2005

netski	adored the galadari colombo	"Travelled to Sri Lanka with an aid convoy after the Tsunami and spent an unforgettable 14 nights at the galadari hotel.  The work was tiring-a combination of stress, tears and feeling unable to do as much as was needed-but what kept us sane was the warmth and homliness of the galadari.  The staff are wonderful-happy, chatty and eager to help with anything they can.  The guy on the door who is in charge of the hotel taxi's was forever asking us how we were-what we were doing-when would we return: the taxi drivers were honest, eager to show us around colombo and went out of their way to ensure we made the most of our free time.  So im pressed were we that we are returning to colombo-and the galadari of course- for 2 weeks holiday in July/August.  Try it-you'll love it!!!"	Date of stay: February 2005
Isha36HoneyBee	Wonderful View	"Have stayed at the Galadhari twice ( Nov '00 and Spt '02) and had a wonderful experience on both occasions. The staff is helpful, the seafood amongst the best in Colombo and the rooms are nice and clean (ask for an ocean facing room as it offers a panaromic view of the sea and the old parliament building). The hotel has a night club that's a bit seedy. Other than that i recommend a stay here if u'r looking for a place that's comfortable and not too pricey."	Date of stay: January 2005
