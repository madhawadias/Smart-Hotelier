Frederic N,Could use a revamp,We stayed at the Clock inn for two nights with the family. This is a small budget hotel but with some effort can be so much more.   Bedsheets were not clean upon arrival and had to be replaced. Staff was not unfriendly but also not very entertaining.   The whole hotel could use a lick of fresh paint and some touch ups. It would really make a difference.  Room was spacious and quiet.   Breakfast was rather poor. Better to get some breakfast a bit further down the street.   Arrangements for airport pickup were done professionally and email communication was great.,Date of stay: August 2019

ManishkaDharmaratne,“Service was hell”,"At the check-in didn’t even bother to greet us. I was the one who wanted to break the ice but it didn’t go well, just sent us to the room. No one came to check whether everything is in order in the room. Television wasn’t working so when i asked them to fix it he just came and looked at it and then he said he will be back when his colleague comes but he never came back. Telephone wasn’t working but I didn’t complain cause I didn’t want that but could have saved some time to go down to the reception by foot. In the morning when i wanted to have breakfast no one was there to guide me I didn’t know anything, everything was all over the place so just drank the baddest  juice i ever had and came out. You are on your own if you are here. Had a taste of typical Colombo bad attitude",Date of stay: June 2019

Devaa,A very pleasant stay!!!,"Reached at wee hours in the morning tired ,but the pleasant greeting of Daniel at reception made me feel so comfortable and welcoming.Every thing is so good location 2 min walk from the beach. Did some shopping at Mini Sou just underneath.Had a fantasist 2 days stay here . Breakfast was good too. Two small drawback is no lift one has to carry the luggage to 3rd ,4th or 5th floor and the bathroom do not have any place to keep your toiletries otherwise perfect. The staircase looked so nice with those wall graffiti in uv light at night.Lucky to have the dorm room all to myself .Will come back again.",Date of stay: February 2019

Haarby,Simple and efficient,"Hostel is clean, well situated, air con works well. The location of the hostel is in a good location and near bars and restaurants.

PaulParks,"Efficiency size room with good AC and great WiFi; cute lounge space in the lobby, some open air tables","Our room was a little cramped with two people plus luggage. Just enough room to get around both sides of the bed. But it was sufficient and clean. Medium size bathroom with shower. Took a little longer to get hot water in the evenings. Window offered a view of a wall four feet away. The chilled common area is the nicest part of this accommodation, with uniquely decorated tables and brightly painted walls. In one corner of the lobby is a lounge area with pillows and a library. Outside the lobby is an open air, shaded strip with a few tables. Breakfast buffet is just outside the lobby.

IanPFarrar,Great little place south of town,"We stayed here as a family of 4 and stayed in the quad room - double bed and bunk beds.   The room was relatively spacious, and great value for money. Breakfast was simple but good - toast and coffee, with freshly cooked omelettes to order - as long as you aren’t in a rush (but that’s the way in Sri Lanka!)  Note that the reception and all rooms are on the first floor (and higher floors), so you need to take stairs to all bedrooms - there is no lift.",Date of stay: December 2018
Trevor D,As pics show and more welcoming than you could imagine...,"Honestly this spot was perfect for us.  Travelled 24hrs from Africa and have been on the road for 4 months - this felt like coming home - in a foreign, previously unknown city.  Staff get top marks and room was just as good, but the people always make the difference.  Both were excellent.  I want to know where these places are when I am enduring long travel days and need a landing spot that will ensure a great start to the 'next' leg... this is one.  Enjoy.",Date of stay: December 2018
Wayne,Great staff and location,Just finished a 3 night stay at the clock inn Colombo.  It was a good location only a 300 rupiah tuk tukride from the train station. The double room was comfortable and cleaned daily.  The air conditioning worked great. The best thing is the management and staff. Always friendly and most helpful with advice about Colombo.  The common areas are kept clean with a fresh cooked omelette for breakfast.  The banana leaf restaurant across the road was recommended by the staff for dinner and was great local Sri Lankan dishes.

Bhupesh S,Bed Bugs in the Bed,"Had a terrible time as was bitten by bed bugs and even spotted a few and so can say please avoif this property.  Yes the property is dated and serious needs some upgrades in terms of furniture.  Only one towel - no face / hand towels  Breakfast is basic water melon for fruits, Cornflakes, egg omlate bread with butter / Jam and tea coffee just basic ....  Many better and new options in this area available but somehow I saw earlier revies and booked this property and regretted it.  May be a good option for backpackers and dorm users but not for someone looking for some basic comforts  Don't expect anything great here   Since the room was already paid for and it was raining heavily that night else i would have seriously moved out in the middle of the night...",Date of stay: September 2018
Sophie W,Convenient and clean,"This little budget hotel on Galle Road is a great place to base in a visit to Colombo if you want to see the city but have a limited budget. It's well linked by the train, buses and taxis to Colombo centre and towards the south coast. We stayed in a double air conditioned room and it was easy to cool the room. Bathroom clean with good shower. It's a little noisy and our bed was a bit saggy. I wouldn't want to sleep more than 3 nights in it. The staff are friendly and helpful and it's open 24hrs. The room rate includes a simple western breakfast with fruit, toast and jam, and eggs cooked to order. There's a fridge and tea and coffee available all the time.  All in all, good value for the price.",Date of stay: September 2018

It is located in the heart of the city, near shopping areas, several good restaurants, and plenty of banks and grocery stores. It was a very comfortable spot to begin our Sri Lankan explorations.

NH54321,Ok for quick stay,"This hostel is ok for a quick stay or stopover. The room was fine, few stray hairs and some dirt in bathroom which wasn’t great. Air con unit was very loud and difficult to change settings which meant we had a bad night’s sleep. It’s obviously a cheap hostel (around £33) but I still think it could have been better value with a few improvements. Very basic breakfast included but quite a few flies buzzing around !

emmettfulkerson,Best Hostel in Colombo H\ANDS DOWN,"Alex the manager and Suba the receptionist, and all their crew will immediately make you feel at home at this incredible place. After a long flight (20+ hrs) I had a clean shower, bed, and TV. I stayed in both the locations (Colombo and Kandy). The dorms, capsule (space ship thing) and private rooms were all amazing!!! The breakfast is great, the staff friendly and helpful. I honestly can't think of anyway of making this place better. It is so easy to meet people from every country. Both locations are set up perfectly for socializing and making new friends. This isn't be chance. The staff put a lot of time into all of the details. On top of all of this the Colombo Clock Inn has amazing Christmas decorations. Today I leave to go to the south to surf. I'll miss this awesome place",Date of stay: December 2017

Aditya,Exceptional experience,"To begin with I was recommended Clock Inn by a friend back home who had visited this place in the past. I made my booking without knowing what am I in for. The staff in Clock Inn made my stay very comfortable. Clock Inn is located in an ideal location close to all the relevant place that a tourist would like to visit. Also it is in a location close to all the malls and most importantly the railway station and bus station. Helpful staff that would do all that is required to make you feel comfortable and at ease. A special shout-out to Saman, the manager who is always at the desk or a call away. The rooms are air conditioned and cosy. The breakfast spread is exuberant and there is free tea/coffee available. It's known as Clock Inn for a reason. There are clocks everywhere.",Date of stay: November 2017

I checked out at 12 on the day of my return and was out meeting friends the entire day. They gave me an option to put my luggage in the cloak room and once i returned they also allowed me to wait in the lobby with my luggage for the time till my cab arrived. they are amazing people, folks. if you are not stuck on individual rooms, the dorms are definitely a brilliant option for you.

Greg P,Could Be Better,"Located not too far from the main sites of Colombo, The Clock Inn is a well known accommodation, offering private and shared rooms. We stayed in a private room and to be honest, we didn't feel it was worth the money. It was a bit dirty and could definitely do with a refurbishment. The bed was fairly comfortable and the shower was quite powerful. However, the TV didn't work and it was a bit noisy with nearby construction works. Plus points were that the staff were friendly and helpful and the location was good. I understand that this is budget accommodation but for $50 we expected a little bit more.",Date of stay: August 2017
Ayesha A,"Chic, clean, central accommodation","The clock-themed hotel and hostel was a great place to stay during our time in Colombo. The staff is the highlight, who were friendly, polite and helpful. We had a super early check-in but were given our rooms after a short wait. This is a low-frills place but the hip, casual vibe and cheerful service is enough to want to come back. You always feel welcome, comfortable and taken care of, as well as safe. The location is also great, just down the road from Galle Face Green and the Fort area. And the breakfast was just enough for a great start to a day - nothing elaborate, just the essentials but has everything you need.",Date of stay: July 2017

James P,Excellent place base a stay in Colombo,"We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights in individual rooms, not the dorms. The rooms themselves are basic, but very clean and comfortable. The staff at are incredibly friendly and willing to help with all inquiries. The breakfast again is basic, but fresh and filling with bread, cereal, eggs made on request, coffee, tea and juice.  The location is ideal if you are looking to explore Colombo either on foot or by auto/uber. Most of the main attractions are within a 30-45min walk depending on your pace. There are shops near by to pick up anything you need and I highly recommend the green cafe just down the road for dinner, which is both cheap and delicious.  The only downside I would note is the ongoing construction work which makes an afternoon nap challenging, but as this revolves",Date of stay: July 2017

The highlight was the staff, in particular the couple running the front desk.  So friendly and super helpful, we couldn't have asked for better.  They helped us sort out our travel arrangements which were proving tricky as it was a holiday (Poya) and just before new year so everything was booked out.  The nicest touch was that, on knowing we were leaving very early the next day (my birthday) they got me birthday cake and put it in with a packed breakfast for us to take on our bus journey.

Hotels are ridiculously expensive in Colombo and this looked like a reasonably priced option but we left exhausted.   Our family of four shared a 4 bunk dorm and although the beds were comfortable the smoked glazing to the communal corridor meant that the room was light all night. On the first night the door to the corridor kept scraping against the floor making a horrendous noise every time it was opened and the next night there was some construction work going on on an upper floor late at night that kept us awake.

Siemens were mixed I think it would benefit from single sex dorms.  Location wasn't great and felt a bit unsafe at night as a female, but tuk tuk was cheap to other areas.

They lied to me and told me it was the same standard, but after a fast search at their website I found out it was a cheaper hotel. After a lot of discussion they finally paid me the difference. I don't know how the rooms are in clock inn but in the other hotel it is very smelly and quite dirty. Would not recommend Clock inn to anyone.",Date of stay: October 2016

The kitchen facilities are a fridge and a microwave. And you can get a safety deposit box if you ask at the front desk.

At night and weekends, they'res secured doors at the entrance, it just gives any traveller the feeling of more security.

zgnail,Good hotel with some regrets...,"This is one of the easier smaller hotels to locate in Central colombo, because it is directly opposite Barefoot and at a T-Junction, Alfred House Avenue.   Again to tell Tuk Tuk Drivers, tell them to go to barefoot and when they turn into Alfred House avenue, just ask them to stop at the end of the road.   Rooms wise, it is a mixed of Dorms and Private rooms. There were a total of 8 private rooms. the corridor leading to the rooms when i was there had a smell. To me i think it is a mixture of repellent and fragrance, but it smell weird. Entering the room, generally it was clean, however in my room, you can see a lack of maintenance as the chair had a lot of mold stains.   In the toilet, it was generally clean with a shower cubicle to prevent the floor from getting wet. Towels",Date of stay: June 2016

He made me feel so uncomfortable the entire time i could not enjoy myself - just writing about it now makes me feel uncomfortable. He made us feel pressured to buy things so that he could get commission and would get visibly angry and upset if we didnt buy anything, even though he gets commission for us just going in, despite the fact we continuously said we dont want to go to these places.

Games and books are also available as well as MAC computers for internet access. The breakfast was simple but quite filling. It is also a fun place to chitchat with other travelers.

Anse,Good location,"We stayed in a private room with private bathroom. Had airco in the room. 24 hour reception available. Smiling and friendly staff (esp. Robert). Breakfast was simple and delicious (loved mix omelette), and clean. There is a shared fridge in the kitchen, where you can store your own beverages or food. As the place is on the crowded Galle Road,it might be noisy in the morning, but very central location and very close to ocean (but can't swim). 200m there is a supermarket, in the shopping mall.  I rate it as 4, as the staff was loud a lot in front of our door early in the morning.",Date of stay: April 2016

The staff all seemed bored and un-interested and the reception was unmanned on more than a few occasions. They were all sitting in the cafe at the other end by the kitchen.  The rooms are stuffy, dirty and in need of maintenance. The toilets and bathrooms were in need of a good clean.  I would like to add that the wifi is very good and the breakfasts are ok. You can choose how you would like your eggs cooked... Omelette, scrambled or fried. Unlimited tea and coffee.  It had obviously gone down hill since our friends had stayed here.

The first room we were put in had a few ants and the hotel manager offered to move us to a different room immediately and that too without hesitation. It turned out that room also had ants, but I guess that's just an overall problem there, but it honestly wasn't like a infestation, just a few here and there. An ant spray was also promptly provided and was very effective, keeping the ants away from wherever we sprayed. The second room had actually just been renovated, therefore one of the outlets in the room was not functioning.

Backpack Adventures,good hostel but horrible bathroom situation,Maybe because of all the good reviews i was a bit dissapointed by this place. The good thing is that the beds are big and comfy. They provide lockers and people are friendly. So for one or two nights it is a fine hostel. the design of the hostel is also very nice and the breakfast is very good. My reason for being a bit dissappointed was the bathroom situation. The shared bathroom for the dorms was quite dirty and the shower cabins very small with nowhere to put your stuff making it a quite creative undertaking to take a shower and get changed without anything getting wet or falling on the dirty floor. On my way back i had a late flight. I had to check out at 12 and so left my bag in the luggage storage.

We could stay together in one room, plan our days ahead, discuss the dives etc.  The clean well organized setup - with large clean towel, clean linen and well organized common shower and toilet facilities made it most welcoming.

On the second floor and confusingly where the rooms start 101 etc are the doubles rooms.   The insecurity of this place is staggering. The main door to the dorms on the second floor does not secure.   All of the individual dorm doors do not lock therefor worst case scenario someone could come in an open entrance door, past reception and up onto the dorms floor and enter with a dorm.

The room was quite small, with little space to move around. They provide water and cups, but no coffee or tea, no kettle and no fridge in the room.

Breakfast was great as there is a self serve bar with cereal, juice, fruit, bread for toast, tea and coffee. Eggs cooked in any style are also available. Also noodles if you prefer.  The pick up and drop off airport service is handy, efficient and reasonable priced. The Wi Fi worked well, and two computers were available for use in the lobby. The staff were consistently friendly and helpful. The manager went out of the way to help us when upon our return at the end of our trip our room was unavailable due to electrical problems.

The bathroom consisted of several shower cubicles, toilet cubicles, a changing cubicle and a sink area and was just down the hall. Bedrooms had comfortable mattresses, air-con, multi-country plug sockets and spacious lockers available for us.  The lounge area was spacious and breakfast was pleasant enough.

The whole hostel was immaculate, air-con in the rooms was good and the lockers were big enough to fit our gigantic rucksacks (and came provided with keys and locks), plus the plug sockets were suited to English plugs. Breakfast was good: unlimited toast, cereal, tea and coffee, with the option to order eggs or noodles as you wanted. All staff were lovely - some didn't speak much English, but one guy in particular gave us great and very clear info about things to do,  how to do them via public transport, and suggestions for our itinerary.

Location is fine - but not close to Colombo Fort where most travellers begin their Colombo journey. A little tip to get there: bus 101 from Colombo Fort will take you there, just tell them to let you off at the british counsil and cross the road and follow Alfred avenue and you´ll find clock inn on your right hand side at the end of the road (a corner).

CatherineBazza,Pretty average - no qtmosphere,"Pretty average stay and the least welcoming of anywhere we stayed in Sri Lanka. Staff were okay but it overly welcome, and can't comment on breakfast as we didn't bother to have it. The wifi reception was absolutely terrible and only worked in the corridor or by the bedroom door which was really frustrating - when reported to staff they assured us they would look into it but there was no improvement. The location was quite good though.   We had an unpleasant experience in the fort area of Colombo - we took the public bus from Galle Road where we (two females) experienced an uncomfortable level of attention from one man staring at us.

This appeared to be an issue for 10 minutes but the two men at reception paid for a tuk tuk to their other hotel about 100m down the road. We ended up having a double private room for the same price and were told that we could go back to Clock Inn for our inclusive breakfast.

The hostel is clean and there was aircon in the rooms. You had to request the remote control for the aircon though, as they seemed to be sharing between rooms. There is no lock on the bedroom doors which is strange. There is a lock from the main stairwell to the corridor with the rooms, but all the residents on the same floor can walk in and out of each others rooms (if they chose to do so). This is the main downside. There were 4 showers, and toilets on the floor we were on, and we never had to wait. The barefoot café is across the road and well worth a visit.

The entry was very nice, but then once in the room: impossible to lock the room and very noisy if someone is speaking in the hall during the morning exactly the day you chose to take a sleep in. The kitchen was disgusting and every equipment to cook (even the water boiler) were not working, except the microwave. Also it's a shared bathroom male/female: I know that at first it confused us, but after two weeks in Sri Lanka we got accustomed to it. Also it's not so close from the fort or Cinnamon garden (way nicer neighborhood to sty in). It was not horrible and cheap, but I wouldn't recommend it.",Date of stay: February 2015

We settled on this area because it is a 15 minute tuk tuk ride from the old city centre and train station, but with the benefit of several good cafes and restaurants in the area. The property is mainly a hostel with shared dormitories and a communal lounge area with floor cushions and breakfast tables, but also with some private rooms. Our private room was very small but just workable with an acceptable bathroom. A flashing light in the bedroom (even when it was turned off) on the first night was fixed the next day.

Lounge area is pretty nice, well decorated, and staffs are there.. but that's pretty much all you get really. Rooms are upstairs and you have to go up some steps up and down, which you will have to do a lot of, since the rooms don't have windows and beds are crammed in small spaces, you won't want to stay there any longer than you really have to. My real problem was with showers/toilets, which all were surprisingly not in good condition considering all the modern interiors the place has going.

It was conveniently located on a main road with a lovely restaurant just to the right (Green Cabin FYI) and opposite a bus station with buses going straight to Colombo Rail Station.  My boyfriend and I stayed in a mixed dorm which was very clean and comfy - which was nice after our long flight here. The shared bathroom was also clean.

Ideal location on Galle Rd, close to a number of good food options, ATM’s etc. Reliable wifi, clean rooms and bathrooms (on the whole), brekky was a good place to meet other travellers – fairly average food though.   The rooms and shared spaces looked how they do on the website, so there weren't any hidden surprises. Staff were professional and responsive, if not overly initiative taking (had to ask for wifi password, no explanation about the free breakfast included in my payment etc).

If you are not booking the entire room the door of your room cannot be locked as they dont give out those keys.   The stay was rather comfortable. I was a bit sceptical about the communal washroom area however, it was clean and maintained that way by the staff at all times.

The communal area is comfortable and a good place to meet other travellers.  The area is tourist friendly, so expect higher prices and hassle from the three-wheeler drivers in the streets around the hostel. We found that the bus was easy to use and much cheaper.

Before booking the hotel, I was impressed by the user's ratings of this hotel but in reality, it is very basic accommodation. The hotel is located on a famous Galle road, where you can find many restaurants, hotels and other attractions. Accessing the hotel from the airport is really a tiredness journey because it is 38 kilometres away from the airport.   The breakfast is very basic and don't expect a variety. They even don't have an iron to provide to guests nor the pressing facility. The staff are welcoming and they always smile at you.

Kavinda88,"Clean, simple, friendly and comfortable","Very happy with the quality of this place. Located fairly close to the sights in Colombo. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Included breakfast is great value. The whole place is very clean. The common-room/lounge area is very nice and comfortable. Very welcoming. Rooms are simple, but have all you need including powerpoints and lights at the head of each bed, and air-con that works. Doors to the rooms don't lock but they have 1 locker per bed for your belongings. Only thing I could suggest is maybe a towel-hook or towel rack in the showers as there is nowhere to hang them.",Date of stay: November 2014

Clare H,Great place for first night in Sri Lanka,We got a bus from the airport and then a tuk tuk straight here - very easy and cheap.  Reception staff are lovely and our room was great- very good air con and great shower.   Our room came with breakfast! I got scrambled eggs which was delish and my boyfriend got devilled sausages (cooked right infront of us!),Date of stay: November 2014
Olga G,Clean Friendly and Stylish,"The hostel is conveniently located on Galle road, which is well connected by buses to Fort where the Pettah market, bus and railway station are located.  The rooms had big lockers, AC, soft mattresses and clean sheets. Shared showers were very clean and comfortable.  The lounge is decorated with old clocks as appropriate for the title of the hostel and add to a nice vibe. The common area is well planned with soft cushions to lie down, sofas to watch tv or a their great video collection. Tables and a well equipped kitchen are also available. Staff are young boys who are friendly, funny and super helpful. The only downside was a painfully slow Internet connection both on WiFi and their computer. Fix it and you will be the hostel to dream of, guys!",Date of stay: October 2014
intrepidtraveller288,"Excellent location, good breakfast and well-appointed rooms. Great value-for-money option for Colombo.","The location is top-notch; right on Galle Road in the heart of Colombo, opposite Barefoot Gallery/ Café and close to Galle Face, the Dutch Hospital, many shops, galleries and restaurants. Fort train station is 10 mins away by rickshaw. The room was clean and well-kept and a generous breakfast spread was offered. Staff were kind and accommodating for my early check in/ late check out requests, and helped me with organising safe transport to the airport in the early hours of the morning. Highly recommended!",Date of stay: May 2014
bonedawg,CLEAN TIDY COOL,"The only room in Sri Lanka you'll find 'too cool' if anything, but still perfect. It's really clean, their wifi works (hoorah) and the location is perfect.

KatieA_1234,"Good rooms, disappointing customer service","I stayed at the Clock Inn in July and had a pleasant stay. The taxi service they use tried to rip us off twice which was concerning, and when telling the guys at the front desk they didn't really do much  about it. Upon departing I realised I'd left a t-shirt in the room and immediately emailed the hotel to see if they could send it to me at my address in Asia. They replied back a week or so later saying they had my shirt and to forward my address; I've heard nothing since! I've emailed and tried to call to no avail. Sucky customer service in general. Overall ok if you want a break from hostels wight out breaking the bank.",Date of stay: July 2014

Joao59,"In the end, the worst way to end an amazing journey...","In the end of our journey through Sri Lanka, we decided to stop for one night in Colombo. Maybe that was not the best way to leave such an amazing and beautiful country, but we wanted to spend some time in the capital... On arrival, we had the worst welcome one could imagine after months of mail exchanges, that looked nice and clear. At the reception desk, we were looked always in a suspicious way, asking to visit our rooms was a kind of fantasy not welcomed, and the only words listen were: ""pay, pay at once..."" (more or less). We had a room for my wife and myself and a dormitory for my 3 sons. The A/C in the dormitory was not working and we were looked like troublemakers in asking for someone to look after that situation or to change an already paid room. Also, this Clock Inn",Date of stay: August 2014

Clarissa N,Okay for a night,"We stayed the last night in Clock Inn. We found it expensive (about 6000 LKS for two people) but Colombo is generally more expensive than the rest of Sri Lanka. The dorms were clean, as were the bathrooms (except that I saw a dead cockroach in one of the toilets). Nevertheless, the receptionists are very friendly and helpful and the hostel styles itself very modern. Breakfast is good and included in the price. WiFi didn't work in the rooms, only in the reception area.  Good place to meet other travellers. We were a bit astonished about all the rules pinned in the dorms for the hostel in general which seemed a bit unfriendly, but maybe necessary.",Date of stay: September 2014
J T,Best hostel in Colombo,"Stayed for 2 nights, very modern and clean hostel. The staff were very friendly, breakfast included was great with sausages and omelettes cooked fresh. Large chill out area with big kitchen. The hostel was cleaned constantly toilets cleaned 3-4 times a day, wifi was fast. What more could you ask for? Would definitely recommend.",Date of stay: September 2014
Y K,Good for the first night,We arrived very late from the Airport and found a taxi for approx. 30€.  When we got there everything was clean and nice.

All in all we were satisfied but it was nothing outstanding.,Date of stay: September 2014

The doors to the bedrooms didn't lock, we asked at reception and they said this is the way it is meant to be. There are big study lockers to put your stuff in and you cannot enter the corridor without a key card so there is little concern for security.  Was surprised at how nice it was for the price, would definitely reccomend!",Date of stay: August 2014
Mayooran N,"Clean Rooms, Great Location",Enjoyed my stay at the Clockinn during my SL visit. This place is very clean and the staff are nice. Great Breakfast as well.

callmethewanderer88,"""Free Internet"" Capped, Marginal Value","First, the room is fine, with a dirty floor. The location is fine. Nothing special about either. And for $45 a night in Sri Lanka, it was barely worth it. We're usually much happier in cheaper digs and the extra money left us feeling flat.  I'm writing to make sure everybody knows their ""free Internet"" is capped at 100MB per day per room. Once you use that, you're done. 100MB may sound like a lot but a solid scroll through Facebook and a plane booking will probably chew up your allotment. And that's for one person. Hope your significant other can do without.  I've stayed at some real flophouses and I can't remember having limited Internet, anywhere. And for the money, in 2014, capped Internet? Come on. Poor value.",Date of stay: September 2014
Stacey-Louise G,"Clean room, good location!",Big thank you to the reception staff for helping/ putting up with my lost baggage drama - they managed to put me through to the airport several times and let me use their phone as mine has died.   Location is good for site seeing and the very lovely Barefoot is across the road and gallery cafe is behind it - definitely worth checking out!   Room was very clean and breakfast was simple but did the job!   Would totally recommend if you're staying in Colombo.,Date of stay: August 2014
Gav C,"Spotless, helpful and well located","We booked clock inn in a rush but we're glad, the hotel was new (built 2012) and in a great location opposite barefoot and no more than 250 rps from the main sites eg fort.  Hassan organised a pickup from the airport which given the late time was great but I think you can save money in this, we paid 3500 rps and heard the taxi counter at the airport does a fixed rate 2600 rps drop off - worth checking.  Room 101 was comfortable and quiet and low rooms preferable due to lack of lift.  Breakfast simple but plentiful (cereals, eggs, toast, fruit, juice etc) and the front desk very helpful so we would stay there again.  Other tips: eat at ministry of crab for the best crab and prawns you've ever had and go for a drink at casa Colombo, very nice setting for a glass of wine.",Date of stay: August 2014

Ismaithliomsaoire,A great place to stay,"I was very impressed with Clock Inn Colombo.  We had a private room which was clean and had all the amenities you would expect for the price.  The air con was a great plus.  The staff were helpful as we had some issues with the airline losing our baggage and they facilitated our request to inform us of its arrival.  The location is somewhat away from Colombo's few touristy areas though and there are minimal eateries in the locality.  Having said this, there are an abundance of inexpensive tuk tuks waiting outside to take you anywhere.",Date of stay: July 2014
Yvonne D,Expensive but good,"This place is a bit expensive after seeing the rest of Sri Lanka,  but the rooms are clean and good. The bathroom is big, it's a mixed bathroom so no long lines for female toilets. They work with a keycardsystem so non guest cannot easily enter the dorms. A locker with lock is provided. Rooms have AC. It's a quiet place, easily found. Due to the distances you have to take a tuktuk to get to touristic sites, but this is also becaue everything is located in different sites of the city.",Date of stay: July 2014
ananya87,Fantastic place to stay especially for a solo female traveller!,"I stayed here this June for 2 days and i found my stay very pleasant. Infact i really wanted to stay in Colombo a few days more just to be able to stay at Clock Inn for a few more days! The staff consists of a decent, kind manager and a handful of friendly, decent young boys , always with a smile on their face! The breakfast was lip-smacking :-). I stayed in a 4 bed dorm and although i was initially apprehensive of staying in a mixed dorm(with other men) it turned out to be very safe and comfortable. The lounge near the reception is another great place to hangout and make friends from all over the globe! The location of the hotel is also good, being right in the heart of Colombo with the sea being a 2 min walk from the hotel. I simply LOVED this place. It was AMAZING!!",Date of stay: June 2014

The 4 bed dorm that i stayed in was clean and spacious. The towels and pillow covers are sort of worn out but still clean. Common areas are nicely done and very comfortable. Special mention about the staff, everyone is extremely hospitable and are ready to cater to any special demands that you have. I needed some translation help with my research work and they readily agreed to that too. Overall a very good experience!

javaman123,Incredibly helpful staff,"During a short but pleasant stay at the Clock Inn, the reception guy, Thyagu, selflessly helped me out more than any other stranger has before. I'd left something valuable in Weligama, and didnt have time to retrieve it before leaving Sri Lanka. When asking Thyagu about possible courier servics, he volunteered to go three hours on a train on his day off, and then help ship my belongings to me. So in addition to being a clean and competetively priced hostel (for Colombo), the Clock Inn seems to be staffed by saints, or at least some of the most helpfil and friendly people Ive met in my travels.",Date of stay: April 2014

I was very pleasantly surprised, the lodging was clean, check in easy and friendly and the room although small was more than adequate. TV channels were enough and curtains thick enough to keep the room dark. Little annoyances like shower door off its sliding hinges, purposely build in gaps louvres of the wooden WC door allowing for ventilation as the bathrooms have no window but also allows for all unwanted sounds and smells to emanate into bedroom...A good transit hotel . Location opposite Barefoot shop ad restaurant , which is great as lunch and dinner therefore made easy by simply crossing the road.",Date of stay: April 2014

Chrys S,"CLEAN, quiet, and great wifi","Reading the reviews prior to booking I was hesitant but loved the cheap price and decent location. I can't speak for the privates but I have no clue what anyone could complain about when staying in a dorm. The sheet, pillow, and towel were freshly clean and each room had cold a/c. The beds felt new and didn't rock when the other person flipped during the night. Even the staff are nice. The main older man is a bit sales-y (i.e. he only wants you to use his expensive taxi company - of which I'm sure he gets a nice incentive) but the rest of the staff is cheerful and really helpful. The lounge area is super comfy to hang out in and meet other travelers. I would definitely stay here again.",Date of stay: March 2014

This hostel is conveniently located on the main street, ""Galle Road"". The nearest bus stop is ""Ceramic"", where you can catch a bus to ""Galle Face"" or ""Colombo Fort"" every 5-10 minutes. Since Galle Road is one-way, maybe taking a bus to ""British Council"" on the next street to Galle Road is easy to get back to the hostel.  The air-conditioned dorm room with individual security locker was pretty cozy. Wi-Fi connection was also very good everywhere. (It seemed each two rooms has own Wi-Fi spot.)

DublinGuy75,Very pretty interior but noise and service let's it down,"This hotel is very well kitted out.  However, the design of the rooms (albeit quiet from the outside) means that the extractor fan from the neighbouring room is very loud.  I also had a number of issues with the room which caused problems. The main one was that the door did not lock properly which ended up in me getting locked inside the room for about 20 minutes.  I was calling reception but no-one was there.   The staff are very friendly but considering this is supposed to be a hostel their knowledge of Indian Visa info/travel in sri lanka is very limited.  They also charge 50RS for printing which is extortionate.",Date of stay: October 2013
PurdyJo,Lovely clean room,"Good location, quiet room, with good a/c. Bathroom was also clean. Tv had English channels. We had a private room and own bathroom, for a budget place, would actually say its a good low cost hotel. Value for money.",Date of stay: September 2013

carsonlegarcon,Very good budget hotel in a city of few such places,"I enjoyed my stay here and found the hotel to be clean, welcoming, fairly well-located (close to Barefoot shop and Green Cabin restaurant) even though I strongly disliked the city. I stayed in the 4-bed dorm which had lockers and frequently cleaned communal bathrooms. The airport transfer was also convenient, in the hotel's own a/c vehicle.",Date of stay: September 2013

Jane H,Great value budget hotel - recommended,"We stayed for 3 nights in early August 2013.  The hotel is in a good location for getting around Colombo, our room (ensuite double) was really comfortable plus the manager was really helpful.  He gave good advice when we asked about the local area and found us a driver for part of our trip with about 20 minutes notice.  The hotel breakfast wasn't amazing value but there are plenty of other options near by if you don't want to eat in.  Good budget hotel, would definitely recommend it.",Date of stay: August 2013

Tony M,"Safe bet, no frills","My experience wasn't quite as dazzling as many of the other reviews on here - I certainly didn't find the wifi quick or the staff especially friendly. It wasn't all that cheap either, amounting to around 7,000 rupees per night for an air conditioned double room.   But it was clean with a good bathroom and a comfy bed. The location isn't particularly interesting, without many good bars nearby, but the Green Cabin is only a couple of doors down and is a good place to have your first rice and curry if Colombo is your Sri Lankan starting point.",Date of stay: July 2013
aflora87,Best budget place in Colombo for sure!,Really friendly owner and the staff. The rooms are clean and comfortable with just 4 beds in each! The showers are nice and warm.

KiwiFemaleTraveller,Sweet!,"I stayed at clock inn in Feb and March 2013  The place is definitely the best stop in Colombo. The staff are lovely, very helpful, it has good facilities and a good location.  I have a lot of respect for the owners, they took me in to stay at their own house when I last minute got stuck in Colombo for longer than expected, as the hostel was fully booked!  I really love it here! I can highly recommend clock inn!",Date of stay: February 2013
benmurrell,"Good bathroom, good price, great staff","I ended up staying at the Clock Inn Colombo because it was the only budget accommodation I could find online before I arrived in Sri Lanka. I didn't book it in advance because I wasn't sure if I would try to stay in Negombo after a late night arrival, but ended up making my way to Colombo and checking in around 3am.  The bathroom was extremely clean - definitely the best toilets and showers I used in all of Sri Lanka. The common area (kitchen/tv area) was pretty nice, but the fact that you had to pay for coffee (nescafe at that!) was a bit offputting.  The staff here were phenomenal - they were very friendly and helpful in everything from finding train times, getting fair prices on trishaws, navigating the bus system, and finding food.  I dinged them for things: the location",Date of stay: May 2013
Simitha,Felt so at home!,"The good: The staff are EXTREMELY friendly and helpful, fast wifi, very clean room (dorm) & common bathroom, smack off the main road so it's easy to catch a ride, very comfy bed, very safe to leave your valuables in your locker The bad: no breakfast - had to go out looking for breakfast, no proper common area to hang out - there's just a sofa in the lobby, had to pay extra for a blanket - which is just a bed sheet (this is the case in most hostels in SL, I eventually learnt)  Conclusion: Despite a few downsides, I absolutely loved it there. Great hospitality and service, had a comfortable stay, and in fact, stayed there again after backpacking ard SL, before catching my flight out",Date of stay: January 2013
TravellerAS80,Clean well equipped dorms,"I stayed here for two nights at the beginning of my Sri Lanka trip. They organised an airport pick up for $25 door to door which was great as we arrived after midnight.   Dorms were very clean, had air-con, wooden bunks (so nice and sturdy) and lockers. Tiled floors meant it was kept clean. No road noise.   Bathrooms were new and mostly clean, although they are unisex.   Staff ranged in their helpfulness.   Located on Galle road, it is an easy walk around Colombo, but about 30-40 minute walk to the Fort district. Tuk-Tuks aplenty though!  I would definitely stay here again.",Date of stay: July 2013
Travelmitz,"Cleanest bathrooms, friendly staff, good price for Colombo","I spent two nights in a single room and one night in a 4-bedded dorm. The hotel was very clean, especially the common bathrooms. Location is ok but not the best. Local train is a 10 minute walk away, buses and taxis can be found in front of the hotel. Staff was always friendly. I can recommend this place.",Date of stay: June 2013
Kallista S,Swish for budget,"Private rooms were fully booked so we opted for the dorm and were impressed! Spacious dorms with aircon and personal reading lights and power points for charging.

Sylvia_Panetta,They need to do something about their front-office staff,"I stayed at this budget hotel for just two days in May 2013. The hotel lives up to it's promise of being a budget establishment, however they seriously need to tweak their staff's service delivery standards. Beginning with the manager Mr.Najmudeen. This man is not at all suited for the running of a hotel. He is rude, loud, stubborn and has no concept of discretion.  Besides that he touts to guests the services of a rather shady van driver who lurks about the hotel entrance. It was only on the day of my departure that I found out that the hotel has its own van and driver. Owner please take note!! Also the entrance door to the hotel was wide open late one night when i got back and the young chap manning the reception fast asleep on the couch in the lounge....anyone could have made",Date of stay: May 2013
Shakil S,Extremely bad start. Average stay.,"Good: Central location. New building. Modern rooms and décor. Free Wifi.  Bad: Indifferent, rude and argumentative staff, No lift in a 4 story hotel, bad odor in bathroom everyday, Towels are changed once in 2 days, No bathroom mat, No view (all windows are facing back of another building which is barely 4 meters away), No mini fridge, tea cattle or iron in private rooms.   Day 1 - Bad start; Tired and exhausted, within 2 hours of me checking-in, I went down to lobby to greet a brother of my Sri Lankan colleague who came specially to welcome me to the country and invite me to their home. As we headed to the room, almost physically and with extreme rudeness and disrespect, a staff and the owner of the hotel embarrassed me by telling loudly “visitors are not allowed in the",Date of stay: June 2013
Xinni,"Basic room, free wifi in room",Room is very basic with ensuite bathroom & tv. Not much ventilation & air is still in the room. Hot water works well. There is macdonald & supermarket close by which is convenient. You can take a tuk tuk to Pettah bazaar for 250 rs.,Date of stay: May 2013
haymorsd,Overpriced,"Pros: My room had air con, free Wi Fi, Cable TV, bed was ok, quiet establishment, friendly staff. Modern contemporary deco design. They have dorms, so there is a common area with a fridge, toaster, stove, dishes, large TV, movie and travel book library, one computer to use and within walking distance to the ocean. Since this was the weekend of the Vesak Festival, the managers took a van load of residents to the temple and dropped us off. I thought that was very nice.  Cons: No fridge in my room. For my standards the room was not clean. Ants, urine smell in the bathroom, large clump of hair in the shower stall (not mine), very dusty. I ask for the bathroom to be cleaned but the mop used was so filthy that the young man was just moving dirt around. Also there was standing water",Date of stay: May 2013

Amin E,V good modern place.,"Although not greatest value for money, it is a decent and clean set of dorms. When I was there the staff were friendly and helped me out with travel questions. When I was there there weren't many backpackers but I'm sure in season it would be a good place to meet people.   They have a solid Internet connection which allowed me to catch up back home.   Location is good, opposite Barefoot cafe. Bambalapitiya railway and buses and tuk-tuks nearby. Good place to stay if you need to be at Fort Railway Station early.",Date of stay: May 2013
knn-44,Nice but not the cheapest,"Pros: Aircon, clean, new, good location, friendly staff (esp. the middle aged cleaning lady)  Cons: Not the cheapest (2,000 Rs for a dorm bed wasn't really value, but given that it was Colombo and new and had aircon/hot water it was acceptable), and the ops were kinda messy (they forgot about my airport transfer and when I was transiting through Colombo again they forgot my booking)  Maybe if a blanket was provided it would be better. It got really cold when others turned the temperature down overnight.",Date of stay: April 2013
Fritzel3,Good Budget Place,Stayed in the dorms. Locker to put your stuff in. Sheet and towel included. A reading light. The owner helped me change some money for a decent rate late at night. Clean.  Not a lot of character. A bit pricey compared to things you can find outside of Colombo.  Decent location. Not a lot of character. Not a great place to meet people.,Date of stay: April 2013
jacobeasaw,Good Value and great location..,"First of all this is not a hotel. A budget stay will mid sized rooms and toilets, common balcony with central access from lobby, strictly non smoking rooms. The room size ok for couple. Bathrooms are neat and clean. Separate shower cubicle and toilet area. No restaurant in this hotel but there are lot of options nearby. Situated in Colombo 3 which is a hub for party life and classy restaurants. Opt for Budget Taxi services as they are reasonable and cheap than regular tuk tuks. The reception is mostly ignorant but do ask the nano taxi/ tuk tuk drivers for better hangout places as per your budget. The hostel is not suitable for family with kids as the facilities are limited. But the stay is value for money and location is great.",Date of stay: April 2013
Rachel W,Perfect for a quick stop in Colombo,"Stayed in the Clock Inn for a couple of nights at the beginning of my trip around Sri Lanka and it was great value for money. My travelling companion had his own room and I stayed in a dorm but both were equally spotlessly clean (and I tend to be fussy!) and with plenty of hot water. Dorm rooms come with key for generous sized locker, bedding and towel. Price does not include breakfast but with Wifi and a good location for seeing Colombo- it is a very reasonable price. Staff were a bit slow, but very well meaning and kind, and it is not licensed so there is not much atmosphere in the evening.  Gallery Cafe around the corner is great though, really lovely setting and affordable but delicious food. All in all a very safe bet.",Date of stay: April 2013
Volcanobuff,Suggestions for betterment,"There's no denying that Clock Inn is one of the better budget accommodation places in Colombo. I liked the location, sober design and friendly staff. There are a few points however that could be improved: why offer ac but not blankets free of charge? If you feel the need to charge extra for things, ask money for towels not blankets. Kitchen area was seriously lacking in utensils, one small dirty fridge for the entire hostel. Also a mirror in the dorm room and 2 chairs would be a nice idea.   What I'm not fond of was the hostels policy to allow sleeping bags since they are a major risk for spreading bedbugs. I saw with my own eyes that the bed sheets weren't changed after every traveller - again, you're asking for trouble... The cleaning lady seems to only empty the waste baskets",Date of stay: April 2013
Stefan D,"Very clean, friendly staf, good location and cheap for Colombo","I stayed here for a few nights in March 2013. There aren't many hostels, or even cheap hotels, in Colombo so I was very thankful for the Clock Inn. Its clearly pretty new but the facilities are very good, excellent showers, and everything is kept very clean. The city was very warm whilst I was there so I was also grateful for the very good air conditioning. I only realized the day before I left but there is also a spacious lounge with a huge TV and sofas behind the reception desk. Staff were always very friendly and helpful too.",Date of stay: March 2013
Boureidy,"Clean ,friendly staff and great location.","We stayed in the Clock Inn  for one night, the hotel was super clean and the staff was very helpful. We arrived very early (9am)  and the staff didn't spare an effort to make our room ready. The rooms and the bathroom were spotless. A week later on our way out of Sri Lanka we had 9 hours to kill in Colombo before heading to the airport and we were too tired to walk around the city with our luggage. So we dropped by the hotel to see if we can keep our bags and they were more than welcoming and they also offered us to use the shared bathroom for showers and we used their amenities for free. It was definitely a very positive experience and I would totally go back. Thank you",Date of stay: April 2013

molanka,Staff stole out of my locker,"I paid three nights in advance.  The first two nights were fine, i returned from a conference the last evening to find my locker had been emptied.  i went down to the reception, where the boy behind the desk said it had been cleared out - at this point I was joined by two friends.  We asked to see the register where it clearly showed that the room had been paid in advance and there was no reason to clear out my things.  When he escorted me to their storage room to retrieve my bag, I found a number of items missing, a bottle of duty free gin that was meant as a gift, (and later a bottle of cologne)..  They had obviously rummaged to the bottom of my bag to see what they could find.

It has adopted the hotel model popular in many other countries - a small but clean / well appointed room in a central city location at a cheap price. Reception staff were efficient and spoke good english. The room was smallish but appointed with everything you need for a comfortable stay. The hotel has a large sitting area with tea/coffee making facilities. The rooms are all no smoking but there is an outdoor smoking area on each floor. Staff were happy to store our bags for the day whilst we awaited our evening flight. Some good quality restaurants are nearby.

We booked a private room and it had everything we needed for our short stay, airconditioning, water, shower, tv, great bed, really fast wifi and CLEAN.

We were therefore very happy to learn that they kept a room for us even though they were fully booked and despite the fact that we arrived well after midnight.  The location is decent, the price is quite high for Sri Lanka (but so is all of Colombo). We spent 2 nights in one of their dorms, the first night right after arriving to Colombo and the second night when we were leaving.
