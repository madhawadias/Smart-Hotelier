Although we had some better hotel experience throughout Sri Lanka, for the price this is a very good value. The rooms are comfy, equipment is fairly new, the whole hotel is very well maintained. Only the AC  was kind of weird and we weren't able to turn it off but it may have been just our user ignorance.  The thing I valued the most is probably staff's attitude. We had some bad 'high-end' business encounters as we were travelling with a rented tuk tuk so we were a little worried. But the staff from Fairway Colombo was indiscriminate and treated us really well though we didn't arrive in a BMW. They even parked our tuk tuk next to the chairman's SUV which we thought was really funny and laughed with the lady from the car park.

My friend and I only stayed one night on our way from Galle before we flew out the next morning. Check-in was very easy and smooth. The room was a tad bit small but for the price and the location it was absolutely worth it. Because we were limited on time we purposely picked this location because it was had so many things near it. Many places were closed by the time we arrived but our main goal was to get a decent meal and a good night's sleep in a nice bed before heading into a day of flights and layovers.

The photo of the front of the hotel doesn't show the full story. It's a narrow busy street with the old Dutch Hospital quarter, with bars and eateries opposite and at night the street fills with people looking for a late night out. Other reviewers have mentioned the noise problem so be aware of it. We were only there for one night but called back again 10 days later just to store our luggage prior to another late night flight.

We didn't eat breakfast there so can't comment on that, but we did pop up to the rooftop for one drink, which was very nice.

Rooms are modern and clean. It’s close to lots of pubs and restaurants and has a great roof top bar. Hotel would have got 5 stars if it wasn’t for the noise. All of the bars are directly under it so it’s very loud until about midnight. Their roof top bar also has parties with really loud music which we could hear on the 5th floor - this went on until about 330am. It is a good hotel if you’re up for all the pubs and stay out late but not if you need to be up early to catch a train or flight.

The hotel is bang in the middle of eateries and money changer shops.  3. Very nice hotel rooms. Rooms are smallish in size, but very neat and clean with modern decor 4. If you are taking a room with a extra bed, the room becomes very spacious and comes with a L-shape design, with a small kitchen area also.  5.

The whole street comes alive with the traditional music and dances of Srilanka. Just opposite to it is the old Dutch Hospital which now houses shopping areas and many eateries. The live band at these eateries and the outdoor seating adds to the charm of a nice evening. Hotel service is good, with very responsive house keeping.

I got a single bedroom with two single beds well-furnished with  basic accessories. I love how they do my bed everyday. It was as if I've never slept on it.

Particularly as we were seated just by where the chef was preparing Sri Lankan food - but for lunch! Thankfully they managed to get some of this for me but only if I went for a late breakfast. That meant that out of 6 nights I had no breakfast for 3 of them. When I had the curry though it was excellent.  Two, we were put on 8th floor for our second 3 night stay. Never again!

First, the breakfasts were awful - easily the worst coffee we had anywhere in Sri Lanka and mediocre, poor quality food. There is a hefty supplemental charge for the breakfast (about USD 10 per person).  Second, we felt ripped off by the taxi booking service at the hotel. We were 2 adults and 2 children (with a modest amount of luggage as we were travelling around). We asked the hotel to book us a taxi pick up from the airport on arrival.
