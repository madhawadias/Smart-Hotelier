What did disappoint were the sea views. We paid for an expensive suite with bath tub and sea views however it is currently a building site with sky scrapers going up all over the place. It truly does look horrendous and not what we expected from such an expensive room on our honeymoon. These views of the building site continued to the infinity pool which was on the same side as our room. Not great for any good holiday snaps!

And the staff checking us in offered us an upgrade! How lovely! My new wife was really excited about it. Then the chap explained we'd have to pay full price for the new room.  ...so not so much an upgrade as an up-sell.

I had to remind myself that this country was still war-torn just a few years ago, and it's understandable that the service standards aren't perfect yet, but with some training I think they could be very good indeed. For example, the check out process took much longer than what you would usually expect. But once again, it's easy to forgive when the staff are as friendly and nice as I have ever experienced.

None of these reasons is acceptable for a late check-in. The request for a discount was not granted until now where we are writing these lines.

The presentation of food items were great as per pictures but taste was no way closer to the presentation. Not many options for the expensive price paid.

If your main focus is the room I don't think you can go wrong here.  However it didn't quite feel like a 5-star experience otherwise. Service was always incredibly friendly but often painfully slow (especially at check-out). Wi-Fi didn't work in my room throughout, and the hotel was unable to fix.  The rooftop bar and pool is lovely - but it often gets very windy or rains, and so the bar closes.

The whole staff wore bad uniforms, and no managers present. Reception is still not familiar with check in  procedure. No travel desk or concierge. They do not know the taxi  rates. Floors have a weird smell. They have non-smoking rooms on a smoking floor, had a blast sneezing the night away!   The excuse given by every single staff member for the bad",Date of stay: January 2017AnuNimbuz,,,C3468SBalanf,Exeptional stay,"We were among the firt guests of this newly opened Hotel and had a exeptional stay.When something is brand new you usually expect problems but everything was perfect.Just to compare ,arriving to the Hotel we were travelling allready in Asia for 30 days,staying in 5 star hotels but this was by far our best experience.We usually dont write rewievs but the staff in Colombo deserved it,big time. Rooms,design,food all was superb.",AHP4,Great rooftop bar,"We stopped at the Movenpick for a drink and a quick bite tonight and loved it. The views from the top floor are amazing, ""bar food"" creative and yummy, and service very attentive.  We're definitely going back.",Date of stay: January 2017Sproutie07,Soft opening,"Having made a reservation for 16 & confirmed for 20 the day before, the team of the Vista Bar where unaware of our reservation....not a good start.   We appreciated this was very much their 'soft opening' and made allowances for this but the bar was being run by a few professionals & a lot of untrained staff & supervisors.....utter chaos.   But, it didn't stop us from enjoying ourselves and we promise to return again soon.    Be warned....prices are pretty high!   I look forward to visiting the other F&B outlets when they come on line.",Date of stay: January 2017LarsJepp,Give it a try!,"I'm a frequent business traveler to Sri Lanka and was thrilled to see a new 5 star hotel open in Colombo. I checked in on January 19th only few days after the hotel opened. I was expecting some service issues and some operational difficulties- but to my positive surprise everything has worked well, no technical problems to speak off, a great comfortable room on 19th floor. Well appointed, quiet and of course very fresh and new.  It with some staff training issues.   Surely a 5 star property in the future - but for this stay it can only be 4 because of service level - club lounge with no wine, no breakfast and few food choices during cocktail hours. and a staff that was very fresh - polite and friendly but lacking experience and level of a true 5 star. Like asking for your room",Date of stay: January 2017Dolly K,Family vacation,Very friendly staff !  The rooftop infinity pool n bar were a real treat. It's definitely not a 5* as claimed But the junior suite was very comfortable though they still have their snags as it's been just 4 days to the official opening . Location is great  and Absolutely worth the price,Date of stay: January 2017buddhika m,Disappointing operations at the hotel,This is really disappointing as a hotel. Dnt knw how do they define them self as five star. We waited nearly hour at the bar to get the bill. They say it's a system down. Now waiting to collect the vehicle which they forcely took for valley parking. Someone has put another vehicle Infront of my vehicle and they say they can't figure out who the owner is.   Have to wait another half an hour and still waiting. Operations at the hotel is a total disaster.,Date of stay: January 2017herbiefrogg,food is devine service superb,the roof top bar need to improve the drinks service was little slow the staff did not know the drinks they serve training is paramount food in the restraint on the 4th floor was fantastic service was very good I can not fault the quality of starter or the main courses keep up the good work .will visit again on my next visit,Date of stay: January 2017
