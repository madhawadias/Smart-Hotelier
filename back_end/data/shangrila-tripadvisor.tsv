"Dinushika","Shangri La - Kaema Suutra","We had our dinner at Kaema Suutra on 11th March 2020. The outside area of the restaurant is little smaller than other restaurants although the food was delicious and surved by extremely professional manner. Staff was highly polite and helpful and took very good care of us since beginning to the end of our dine. A special thank should go the hotel for inventing new herbal handwash to it's guests. The herbal handwas made by using Sri Lankan herb plant - ""Iramusu"" was very good and for me it was really nicer than the chemical handwashes. Thank you shangrila for making our day a remarkable one. Definitely the one of bests in Sri Lanka.","Date of stay: March 2020"

"Bes","Dinner Capital bar and Grill","We are staying in Colombo and went to this restaurant/bar. On arrival all the staff were very welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable.  Great cocktails and lovely Champagne at reasonable 5 star prices. Dinner was delicious with large portions, great presentation and service. When I mentioned I could not eat dairy the chef came to our table to discuss my menu choices which gave me confidence that they understood my dietary requirements. Our waiter Kavindu was excellent and we enjoyed his professional and friendly service. After dinner we stayed to enjoy the music in the bar which was also a really good high standard. Security on arrival was excellent and we felt very safe in the hotel. This really is a great hotel to visit in Colombo.","Date of stay: February 2020"
"Shabana H","The best place in Colombo","Whether it’s a weekday or a weekend, Shangri-La Colombo has been “the” best host for family and friends. From Dj Ruki to the management and staff, they have really offered a five star service every time we visit Kaemasutra. The staff here at Kaemasutra is the main reason why we are regulars. Much appreciation to Michael (manager) Dulaj, Ashane, Jagath, Shehan and Kalana are amazing! Nowhere else in Colombo offers the welcome they showcase. As a hotelier, I give a big thanks to the management as their work ethics reflect on how their staff mirror Service toward guests.   Kudos towards the management and staff at Kaemasutra!

"Hannah","Shangri-La Colombo","Colombo is not a strange destination for me. I have done many flights to Colombo as a cabin crew but this was my first stay in Shangri-La Colombo. In many other hotels we don’t get much attention may be because we are cabin crew (glorified waitresses) . I met this incredible gentleman at check in Mr.Hashan who comes from cabin crew background. He is simply amazing and yet very professional. When I did not like my room and returned back to lobby hashan did not ignore me. He was very kind enough to change the room and took time to check on us till we leave the hotel.  I have noticed he is very friendly with every customer who walk cross the lobby. The hotel has a good selection of restaurants. I wish I was there to explore all restaurants. The housekeeping staff were very nice.","Date of stay: February 2020"

"Mr_Mi","First class really","Stayed here for 3 nights as the last part of our 2 week holiday in Sri Lanka.   We stayed in a horizon club room. The first room we were given smelt musty, it was a corner room. Upon reporting it, we were swiftly moved to another room without any fuss.   We wanted to relax and not rush on the final part of our holiday and we were able to do that. Using the gym, pool and even booked in for a massage as well.   The Horizon Club benefits were soo good that you could pretty much eat in the lounge and not have to go to the restaurants at all. We did go out to eat in the steak restaurant downstairs and in the mall just for a bit of variety.   The staff were attentive, polite and courteous and asked if we had everything we needed.

The facilities are immaculate, the location is great, the food is excellent and most of all, the staff is as good as it gets.   The manager, Radinki (believe correct spelling) made such a difference in our trip. Despite having a full hotel due to a conference, she made us feel as though we were the only guests there.

"Frederic Widell","Business hotel","I’ve stayed here several times and it is a very nice property, very courteous staff but somehow it’s not all the way to excellent. It’s very expensive overall and airport pick-up and drop off is 4-5 times that of Uber. It becomes a bit ridiculous. I will stay here again because of its location and classy property but I feel it’s more of a business hotel than a relaxing resort/vacation property. Hoping they can maintain this level, minimum, otherwise this property will be overpriced. I recommend the rooms that have balconies.","Date of stay: February 2020"

The concierge team with Anzil and Dimuthu did an incredible and amazing job when I needed to get something from the Sri Lankan customs office at the airport.

The lounge is a nice place to chill and relax.   The hotel is attached to the mall which has the major brands and restaurants.   The location of the hotel is excellent and the view from the room is just superb. Ask for a sea facing room.  Only thing the hotel should add is Airport pick up and drop (at least for the Suite). This is done by major hotels.  The hotel delivered a cake and chocolates and a bottle of wine to my room for the occasion of our anniversary.

Also it’s right by Galle Face Beach (no railroad track) so you can enjoy watching the sunset... or you can enjoy right from the hotel rooms & restaurants.  My only feedbacks are.... -Teach staff to pull proper espressos. -An requirement to order food & drinks when using the cabana at the pool (a German family took up two cabana for hours, likely the entire day with no service).","Date of stay: January 2020"

The bathrooms are large and luxurious. The staff are very courteous and friendly. We did have an issue with our room and some lack of communication regarding this. Feedback was addressed promptly by the higher management and made us feel as our complaint didn’t just fall on deaf ears which is always a risk in large hotels. Breakfast and horizon club was great and having horizon club access was excellent as it gives you breakfast, a light lunch if you want it, afternoon tea and canapés/drinks in the evening.

"Samanthie G","Shangri La creates new ways to fleece customers","Visited Shangri La to collect a guest.  Unlike any other place Shangri La charges Rs. 500 for valet parking.  (this is 10 times the normal rate per hour in SL and Valet Parking is a free service in Sri Lanka as part of the hospitality industry).  When the concern was raised was told that this is a VALUE ADDED Service.  In other words, Shangri La is not a welcoming place.  This is not the first times the hotel tried to fleece unsuspecting customers.  As they opened they sold normal fish buns and other buns for exorbitant prices which shocked the Colombo community.  Guests are advised to check the rates stated and unstated before they avail themselves of the hotel services. To say the least the charging practices are totally unethical.","Date of stay: January 2020"

Exceptional hotel facilities, Oceanview room accommodations and the quality of food and beverages were outstanding.  We were in a Horizon Club level room and the staff across all parts of the hotel were very attentive and provided us with excellent service.  We were made to feel at home and very comfortable throughout our long stay at the hotel.

Dumbells go up to a decent 40kg, and they have a squat rack and a functional cable machine, in addition to all the usual stuff.  Service is top-notch, and security was extra tight, due to the recent bombings there, so we felt very safe. The only problem we had was that the room was very dark and gloomy.  Other that this, we had a fantastic trip, and will definitely return here again.","Date of stay: September 2019"

The room looked new, was spacious and very well presented. There are some little things that just always annoy me in hotels and non of these were present here. The room is actually designed to accommodate two people, unlike most - even in suites. When you walk in there was a small powder room on one side and a beautiful walk in robe on the other. It had space for 2 suitcases (which is something that is always missing) and enough hangers for 2 people to hang their clothes (I usually always have to ask for more hangers). The robe opens to a great bathroom with lots of towels, and yes room to hang more than one used towel. The amenities are lovely and there are lots of them.","Date of stay: November 2019"

The staff are exceptionally warm and hospitable.  The rooms are large and nicely appointed.   We had access to the club lounge on the 32nd floor and it’s very nice.  We were able to eat all our meals there.    It’s unfortunate indeed that people who consider themselves to be world travellers would be put off by the recent terrorist incident in Sri Lanka.   The hotel occupancy has been down since then in spite of the fact that tragic events can occur anywhere at anytime.

At times I found a hotel of Shangri la standard so poor in service. It seems they are more like one of those 3-4 star hotels when it comes to service and quality. Unfortunately there are not many quality options for frequent flyers in the area so one has to stay. But my sense is once the other ones come up soon, I am sure this hotel will be one of those where people would stay only if they don’t find a place.","Date of stay: October 2019"

Despite all the excavation work going on we did not hear any noise from the room. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom of decent size and functional, except we found the toiletries with very strong jasmine fragrance.   Breakfast had a lot of variety but most of Sri Lankan dishes were a little hot for us.

We were very well entertained by waiter Jeremiah Bernard who was very mannered and gave us a great service. I would recommend this waiter to any class hotel. Also supervisor Menake welcomed us very friendly and gave us a table with great ocean view. One of the cooks, Fernando, surprised me with a fresh avocado which was initially not available though plenty for decoration on the buffet with lots of other fruits.

Had to go up to 2 different waiters and tell them to send the dessert and bill. Even after this, had to get up and go tell another one to send the bill again. It’s pointless repeating the rehearsed lines of “is the meal okay” etc if you are simply not attentive and don’t really care. Terrible Service.

The hotel is flooded by Colombo's elite during all hours of the day and is a busy place for Weddings and Engagements.   Too many business meetings take place in the Breakfast Lounge thus removing the relaxed holiday feel you desire. Would be an option to create a bigger area for the Breakfast and Dinner buffet (it's already quite spacious). A little more respect shown towards the friendly and caring catering and restaurant staff would be nice especially by Colombo's 'elite' locals, certain tourists and some management staff.","Date of stay: November 2018"

We went there for a family and friends get together, and also to experience the newest addition to the Colombo hotel scene. We were genuinely underwhelmed by the experience. The lobby decor although being shinny was generic, with no affiliation to the country it is in. As far as the Table One restaurant is concerned, the service was good, although the food variety and more importantly the taste was mediocre at best. The only decent bit of the buffet (priced at Rs 3,000+) was the desserts, where they had managed to pull-off a proper cheesecake, as opposed to the gelatinous nonsense that other 5 star hotels in Colombo offer. All in all it was just another 5-star hotel experience, and did not live-up to the hype.","Date of stay: January 2019"

Exceptional ambiance with great music, the interior was eye catching, highlighting the great local historical culture and we specially enjoyed the starter “deep fried godamba roti” which was on the house and were offered more on request which definitely became a family favorite. From drinks to starters, mains and desserts everything was phenomenal and was worth the money since it was Sri Lankan cuisine on a whole new level.

I got to see so much that I wouldn’t otherwise have seen myself.","Date of stay: December 2018"

All staff were very helpful and for the most part welcoming and friendly. Very good breakfast and lunch service - amazing food and very accommodating.  Also had dinner at the same restaurant - see separate review - food was ok but service was very slow.

However the management quickly reacted to an email inquiry and sorted out the matter. We have received a very warm welcome by the front desk manager who apologized for the incident.

My main and initial contact point was Mrs Kokila Perera who have supported us in plenty of ways for whole reservation process. She was very energetic and a role with 'can do' attitude which is truly commendable. When we arrive she guided us to the restaurant and surprisingly gifted a beautiful flower bunch to my wife which we never expected.  Once we stepped on to the restaurant she introduced us to an amazing personality chef Vipula. The support and the detailed information rendered by chef Vipula about number of cuisines available was amazing. He always took extra effort to double the taste of cuisines with his charming smile and the touch of international service","Date of stay: December 2018"

A brand new, and very comfortable hotel, but the difference was the service.  Having left in the morning for the middle of Sri Lanka, we discovered an IPad had been left in the room. Being 6 hrs away, we contacted the hotel who had found the IPad - but we struggled to understand how we could have it delivered to our next accommodation.  The choice appeared to be between a US$250 car or a much cheaper Express Post Service - that needed cash upfront!   However, solved at very little cost, as the hotel simply asked a staff member holidaying near us to bring it to our hotel.    Possibly just lucky - but the Shangri-La made that luck","Date of stay: December 2018"

The arrival was smooth and impressive through a very professional team at reception (paperless check in) and a really impressive festive decoration throughout the hotel. The overall stay was really superb and among the best experience I can recommend are: a) the dining at ""Table One"" is absolutely fantastic and conducting some work, both focus & creative at the ""CONNECT"" co-working space feels good and inspiring!

This is probably why it was so deserted.  Restaurant was ideally located and good ambience.","Date of stay: October 2018"

My upgrade was supposedly to a room with a fantastic evening view that had didn't have any kind of view at night.  Sheraton is about to open and Ritz-Carlton is being built.

Although I'm familiar with the brand, the opportunity had never come up to stay at one of their hotels. This was also my first time visiting Sri Lanka, and I'd read some great reviews regarding this hotel. The hotel is spotless, and in a great location for exploring all that Colombo has to offer. The real standout for me was how friendly and accommodating all of the staff were. I'd like to give a special nod to Dulaj Lakshitha, who works as a fitness coach, at what is probably one of the best hotel gyms that I've ever seen.

The Horizons lounge offers free drinks and canapés for two hours from 17:30 each day.  The one thing that sets this hotel apart from other five star hotels around the world ... the staff.

Impeccable service. Good breakfast spread. WiFi and all. With pools, gym, spa etc. Moreover the hotel faces the sea across an unpolluted and non-contaminated beach. Blue waters of the Indian ocean lap the water's edge. Great views from a 32 storeyed structure. Though I doubt you could get to the water as some reclamation level activity is on. But great for walks and jogs.  Lunch and dinner were part of the package so can't comment on that. It's slightly pricey. However serves 3 times the amenities compared to a hotel in any part of the world at the same cost. You might miss ease of access to public","Date of stay: November 2018"

The breakfast buffet could not offer more choice if it tried, everything so fresh and such excellent quality. The 2 in house restaurants were both faultless and offered a varied menu. A must being the French Onion Soup in Capital Grill. The bar staff in Kaema Sutra (particularly Dulag), Captital Bar and the Pool Bar were the best. Anything requested, whether on the menu or not, they executed perfectly. All in all I would thoroughly recommend the Shangri La Hotel.

"DrVivienne","Amazing Shangri-La","I would stay here again in a heartbeat. It was simply fantastic and the level of service was great. I rate hotels on service, not pretty rooms. I was a bit shocked when they said they had only opened last year as it is unusual for a new hotel to be that good when they hadn’t been operational for a long time yet. Special shout out to Ravichandran the duty manager who helped me sort out my flight to the Maldives as we were having so many problems with Sri-Lankan airlines. He didn’t have to help! Also sorted out a minor issue we had with such grace and competence I haven’t experienced from a manager before. All in all an amazing experience - we stayed in the executive suite. Lovely.","Date of stay: October 2018"

So decided to stay one night .. on arrival the concierge guys are like any other 5 star hotel ... we were checked in decent time .. Did not take much time   Arriving in the room... you definitely don't find it as if you are entering a new property.. rooms are just about decent ... you don't get the WOW feeling   Lobby definitely is unimpressive,  swimming pool is small   FOOD IS THE WORST I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE , they have no options whatsoever for vegetarians.. being a 5 star property and that too srilanka ... where more than 70% of your tourists are Indians... and you don't have Indian food options.. very surprising   We decided to opt out of buffet as they were charging","Date of stay: September 2018"

I felt cheerful even I was lonely business trip. Dinner buffet at table one restaurant was exceptional good and best food I tasted in Colombo.

We chose a room with access to the private lounge, which was spacious and had a good selection of complementary food and drinks. The food was excellent but sadly the complementary wines on offer were very poor; not at all suitable for a luxury hotel. Luckily, though, the Bloody Marys were excellent, so we weren't complaining too much.  The hotel is nicely located on the waterfront and in a historic part of town.

Most importantly the service at this hotel is outstanding and can not be compared to any other hotel.  The degree of care and service extended to you makes you want to keep going back and convincing others.  It’s so homely cause of its staff and special mention goes out to Tim the GM and his staff.  I would fail if I do not mention Nadeesha from Capital Bar and Grill and Denvor these 2 individuals demonstrate what a team could do to win the heart of any customer.

We were told that it would be impossible fulfil the order anytime soon. Amanda recalled my daughter’s partiality for this snack.

The breakfast is of a very good standard. The bedrooms a decent size although all very uniform.   One downside is it does overlook all of the work currently being done to reclaim land for further investment in Colombo, however it can’t be heard and the quality of the hotel more than covers for this.","Date of stay: May 2018"

Was very polite and helpful until the last minute. He made sure everything was perfect for the two of us. I wanted him to arrange a small cake for my husband and that was out of this world. But unfortunately the restaurant guys messed it up for us. We wanted to have the cake after dinner and wanted them to keep it till then. But we were told that the cake has fallen by mistake and was also told that they would offer another cake instead. But we just got a small slice of a cake from the dessert corner. This was disappointing and we returned the cake. Apart from that incident everything else was perfectly done","Date of stay: May 2018"

Here there were many Chinese clad in traditional sarongs helping and guiding the visitors.        The lounge has a view of the ocean overlooking the Galle Face Green. The decoration is so stunning that I think the colours were so lovely and calm. The ocean view was wonderful. The location is at a very desirable spot in Colombo and you're on a hill overlooking the Indian Ocean (great spot for sunset when the clouds cooperate).

You will not have any complaints about this place.  One area they could improve is food. While the choice is many and really plentiful, some local delicacies like hoppers and steamed idiappams dont look fresh, though they are hot, you can see the dried corners and it looks like re-heated stuff. This must be missing the management attention otherwise definitely they would have resolved this as they are quiet serious about business and really good!","Date of stay: June 2018"

From the moment we stepped in, we were treated to a superlative experience in service from the likes of Andrew, Devin and Rajitha.  Nothing seemed too much and I must commend the level of attention they paid to the guests. This set the tone for what proved to be a great dining experience with an excellent choice at the international buffet. The variety was great but I felt the meats in the western section bordered on bland. Whether that was intentional given the range of sauces, I have no idea. However this is my personal preference. All in all, I see no reason not to return. Soon.","Date of stay: May 2018"

The hotel has a strict policy that the pool area is for use of hotel guests only - hence it is always very quiet and relaxed.

Rooms are comfortable with great beds but I found the rooms a bit tight for  two people.   Bathroom is large but be very careful in the shower   The floor is extremely slippery when wet.  Nice view of the water but the Chinese are “creating” an island that will have a casino, mega hotel and other “attractions” that will block some of the views. It’s a very busy place with lots of activity.  The breakfast buffet was akin to walking the streets of New York during rush hour.   I thought the prices were a bit high in the lobby restaurant. I felt it was a big convention, downtown hotel and really nothing “special”.","Date of stay: April 2018"

To be quite honest, none of the 5 star hotels I've been to have that much of a variety of food on their menus. From local to gourmet to the exotic, the food was so tasty.

As one example, printing a 1 page eVisa for my next stop involved many calls and conversations over 2 days, and when assured it was fixed, printing a 1 page airline eTicket on my final evening resulted in exactly the same void.  I acknowledge that this is a relatively new property, but these are not typical teething problems;  rather a severe lack of responsiveness and respect for a guest making a few queries and","Date of stay: April 2018"

We highly recommend the Shangri La for Business guests, tourists and for families as well. The rooms are luxurious as the whole hotel and the views are just stunning! Pls try all the restaurants, one is better than the other. We were at Kaema Sutra (another recommendation is the Ministry of Crabs just around the corner, 400 m), Table One, Shang Palace, Capital Bar & Grill - amazing. At the Spa we did the Signature Asian Blend Massage and the Authentic Ceylonese Facial, oh yesss! As soon as you arrive at the impressive lobby you feel at home and everyone is so very friendly and helpful. We definitely will comeback, this is our place to stay in Colombo!","Date of stay: May 2018"
"Frank J","Not suitable for business meetings","Having visited this hotel last year, we dropped by to the hotel lobby for a meeting. The music was extremely loud and somewhat like a pub. Therefore we checked-in to the pub which was quick comfortable and soothing Music, However the drama began when the Vocalist of the band was disturbing us after each and every song, walking to our table and forcibly trying to get us involved in her performance. She kept talking over and over again mostly about where she came from(which did not concern any of us). Not having a choice to change places(as the are out side was patronised by smokers (which I can't complain) we had to move away to venue nearby.  However I must complement the staff for their courteous service and smile on their face.","Date of stay: April 2018"

As in a hotel the most important is the welcome and check-in part (where we really see the standards of it), he made us feel and realise that this hotel is really a 5* and that it met our expecations and wishes! The bar with all the bottles, the terrasse and the live music is awesome, we had some great drinks and a very careful staff! Rooms are comfortables and very luxurious!

Extremely comfortable layout, with a good size kitchenette with a spacious living area. The staff here are extremely helpful, friendly and polite. The salt water pool on the 4th floor along with the Spa are amazing.  There is a lot of construction around this hotel at the moment, so your views may not always be fantastic.

Lot’s of different restaurant options, my colleague and I were pretty beat from our journey and subsequent series of meetings and elected to choose some ‘light bites’ from the bar menu kinda ‘tapas’ style.

The lobby is very welcoming and the views from the lobby are getting better as the gardens around the Hotel are growing and blooming adding to the atmosphere of the Hotel. The staff were also very courteous and hospitable. However, as we experienced the first time we went to the Lobby last year as the hotel was opened, the presentation of the drinks and food was not quite measuring up to a 5 star hotel. It may be small matter but details matter, especially in an establishment of this caliber. Example being drinks coming without garnish such as lime wedges etc. Hotel will do well to pamper the guests little bit more.","Date of stay: March 2018"

However, on our third visit, we were seated in a different area of the restaurant and wound up with a broken table and had to move. The issue was resolved. But, we expected the staff to check equipment. Overall: we would highly recommend the hotel. The table is the reason for “4” rating.","Date of stay: April 2018"

The property looked smart and modern, with lots of marble, panoranomic glass windows and high ceilings.   Regarding the staff,  while they were by no means terrible, on a couple of occasion the service fell short of what one would expect at a top city hotel - as I presume this Shangri-La is positioning itself to be.   On the first night a false emergency alarm went off, with an annoucement suggesting something more nefarious than a fire. While there was a follow-up announcement apologizing for the mishap, the fact that the receptionist sounded noticeably annoyed when I called to double-check five minutes later was regrettable - yes she was likely bombarded with other calls, but only as a result","Date of stay: March 2018"

I reserved a kind bedroom however on both ocassions the reception told me I had booked a twin room. Also I was told that I would be signed up for the Golden circle on my first visit but I never received anything.

The familiar Shangrila aroma you smell in every Shangrila around the world reminded us of home.  We requested for a room on a higher floor & check-in was kind enough to arrange for it.  Our room 2308 was comfy & cosy and served our needs. Housekeeping was very diligent in keeping our room clean & well-stocked.

That said, their recently opened Colombo destination feels like it has been rushed.  The whole complex is still very much in development with 2 towers and a large podium mall still in construction. The completed tower feels like the finishes haven't been at the highest quality that you'd normally expect from a Shangri-La destination (finishes peeling in the lift, hotel lobby lacking in dramatic punch, carpets and corridors decidedly average, etc).   The balcony and outdoor areas suffer from the hotel's proximity to the port city reclamation project.  Whilst impressive to view, it does add to the dust/smog/haze in an already over polluted city.

A most enjoyable experience! Added bonus, decided to walk down to the car park area and got up close as possible with the back of S.W.R.D's statue!

"Pedro D","Great Stay","Hotel Shangri-La Colombo is a perfect place not only for business travel but also for couples and families. Together with my girlfriend we had a great 3-night stay in this brand new hotel located in the heart of the city. Our suite was on the 17th floor with a beautiful ocean view. The hotel itself has everything you need: 2 kinds of restaurant, bar, swimming pool, spa and fitness room and it can easily organize city tours for you. What we liked the most was the breakfast buffet where we could try typical Sri Lankan delights together with a wide array of western options.  It was a great start to our travel to Sri Lanka. We had a great stay. Thank you, Shangri-La Colombo, for making us feel special :)","Date of stay: February 2018"

"sherylny","A very nice hotel with room for improvement","This hotel definitely has the potential to be absolutely amazing, but it isn’t quite there yet.  The hotel is beautiful.  The rooms are comfortable.  The pool is lovely.   However, the service is not yet up to the standard of other Shangri-La hotels.    Breakfast was very tasty offering tons of options from both traditional Sri Lankan cuisine and western cuisine, but the service was lacking.  You had to flag someone down for a refill of tea/coffee and empty plates were rarely cleared from the table.  The pool is beautiful.  But the pool service was spotty at best.  You had to chase down a waiter to get a drink.  The complimentary coconut water and flavored water is a nice touch.  Definitely recommend catching a sunset from the pool deck, which will be even more spectacular once","Date of stay: February 2018"

Bathroom laid out well with hairdryer and magnifying mirror, bath and shower. Great ambient lighting throughout. Amazing large windows with a wonderful view of the ocean albeit most of it is currently of the new financial city being built in the sea. Pool area was lovely. Sunbeds very comfortable. Pool staff lovely. Table One Breakfast buffet was amazing. Best of any 5* hotel I’ve stayed in. Gym facilities were very good. My father who is disabled stayed in an accessible room.

However, we were unable to locate a representative from the hotel or the travel agent. We did locate the Shangri-la Hotel courtesy booth. However, when we ask the staff of Shangri-la, he replied with a grunt and pointing to the next booth, The Kingsbury.  The Kingsbury, as we were informed, is the flagship hotel of Hayley Tours.

Service was also not all that great since the guy who was in charge of our section did not even smile or thank us when we left. but that's not all that important we go for the food and its taste not for the beauty of the restaurant and its ambiance. felt like paying 3300 per head for the ambiance alone! nothing taken in terms of food so frustrated! hate the place","Date of stay: February 2018"

But this time in Colombo this was a real catastrophe. The hotel is well located and is a nice property. This is just about the positive. Service is far below par. Extremely slow and inefficient in restaurants. Service of the room inconsistant. Customer care not really visible. It looks like you’re here to give your money and should be happy to be there, irrespectively of the quality of service. There are other good hotels in Colombo and other ones like the Hyatt to come soon, so unless you want to be disappointed, just pass your way.","Date of stay: February 2018"

We felt quite underdressed at times and could not enter at least one of the restaurants which was our fault, but unfortunate. The lobby was grand!

It is very well placed on Galle Face Green and despite surrounding building work, the rooms were well sound proofed and quiet.  The views were wonderful from our suite and from the executive lounge.  We dined at Shang Palace where Akalanka and Zeenas guided us through the menu and gave us excellent service. We enjoyed it so much we went back a second time.  We had a brilliant dinner buffet at Table One with our family where Sha Shindra and  Rashintha looked after us so well when we could have been easily confused by the choice available.  Everyone enjoyed the occasion.  Finally the executive Lounge staff","Date of stay: February 2018"

I was frankly a little taken aback by the in-room coffee (sachets of Nescafé!) and tea selections - pathetic for a hotel that charges a very hefty premium over the other 5-star properties in Colombo. The Spa Ceylon bath amenities are not very high quality either. More than anything, the staff were not at all at the level expected of a Shangri La property - they appeared inexperienced, unsure how to execute minor tasks during check-in and check-out (asking colleagues for help, for instance).

Even though I had the e-mail showing that the hotel had confirmed pick up, they did not have me on their list, while having other travelers on their list. The restaurant on the lobby level, the bar and grill, is expensive and not very good, but even worse, if you ask three people for one glass of wine it takes them a long time to remember and get it to you.  My room was to be serviced at 8 a.m. on a holiday - I asked the staff to return in half an hhour - two hours later they were not there yet. I called for room service and htey forgot - I had to call 40 minutes later to see","Date of stay: January 2018"

Furniture & fittings, layout, facilities were all very good although it was only few months after the opening. The apartment itself was equipped to a very high residential standard including the compact kitchen, six seat dining table, fridge/freezer, washer/dryer, a dish washer etc. Master bedroom en-suite with bath was great, another shower/toilet was included for the 2nd bedroom.   Little bit of confusion with the light switches plus doors of cupboards clashing with each other in some areas.   The apartment was on the CBD side, 8th floor.

The hotel exceeded all expectations and I having been  a Golden Circle member nearly 18 years.  I cannot do other than recommend this hotel wholeheartedly as `the Best`.  I would like to convey my sincere thanks to staff member Manisha Dinekshi particularly---she  was a star and made me feel like a long lost friend.  She deserves to be recognised as a serious management contender in the very near future. Also my thanks to Marie Malleappah in the hairdressing salon.  Both my visits resulted in a better end result than I could have expected in a London West End salon .  And it was all done with such kindness and dedication.

Though the exterior of the hotel was lazily designed from a distance, when you get inside you're greeted with the finest interior of any Sri Lankan hotel. The staff are warm and friendly throughout. I've eaten at Kaema Sutra and Table One. The latter is as you'd expect from a 5-star hotel buffet restaurant - very good. The former is disappointing. I would advise anyone to get in a taxi and go try proper Sri Lankan food from somewhere such as Upalis, Nuga Gama (Cinnamon Grand), or a random roadside 'hotel'. Failing that, make friends with a Sri Lankan and they'll make you go to their house to eat their home-cooked Sri Lankan food - it blows this out of the water.","Date of stay: January 2018"

A couple of us were lucky enough to get appointments at their spa - which was always booked solid - and really enjoyed our massages. We explored the city by tuk tuk which was fun and also walked around quite a bit. Colombo is an up and coming destination if the amount of construction means anything.  Go and check out this city and hotel.","Date of stay: January 2018"

A few pros and cons:  Pros - Exactly what you would expect from a new skyscraper - very large with a number of facilities (pool, spa, several restaurants). - Very nice rooms including comfortable bed, a hot, pressurised shower (a rarity in SL!), well thought through lighting and good views (the river view is actually nicer than the sea view) - No insects or mozzys anywhere to be seen.

Waiting needed items (that were not in room) took ages. For example I was waiting shampoo around 1,5 hours (!), even called to concierge as wondered if they forget about me or how it happened. During my waiting I had dinner and my bath got almost cold.   Third.  You can read opinion of some workers on their faces, and it looked like that was not really good opinion without any reason.

Prices of food in most Sri Lankan restaurants marked on the menu are not the actual price you pay at the end. You have to add about 30% which includes vat, service charge and various other government taxes. We opted for the Sri Lankan high tea which included a number of SL delicacies. Unfortunately ""lavaria"" was out of stock and instead we had scones.  It was a delightful experience","Date of stay: November 2017"

Sri Lankan restaurant not open yet etc. The hotel lacks soul, no greenery, a lot of concrete. And it is not ready. For example wines advertised on the menus are not available, their signature Chinese restaurant do not have tofu, asparagus rice has no asparagus, service very slow in restaurants, the staff not very experienced and struggle with English although they are trying their most, the hair dryer in the room filled the room with smoke(apparently because it was new), restaurants are supposedly fully","Date of stay: December 2017"

The staff are top notch and make the experience what it is. They are courteous and professional, and you can feel a strong sense of pride in being part of this long-awaited opening. No request is too small, and I have had 2 Duty Managers go far beyond expected service, to find me the information that i was looking for.  The rooms are bright, clean and very well appointed.

From that point, it was all down hill. Food and drinks took a long time to come. Food quality was decent. However, getting the attention of a waiter was challenging. After a number of attempts to get the bill, finally got the bill, only to realize that we had been overcharged. Again, with the greatest difficulty, managed to point this out to a waiter who took it back to correct it. Had to wait for almost half hour and remind 2 waiters subsequently, just to get the corrected Bill. With a delay of this nature and overcharging, expected at least a genuine apology rather than a plastic one. Very poor service recovery. Still early","Date of stay: November 2017"

However, the main entrance of the property doesn't live up to the Asian ambience and the expected welcome.   Perhaps due to the novelty experience the Table One dining restaurant was full last night. However, the food quality was very disappointing. Under cooked shrimp on the grill, half done hoppers, smelly water tumblers, incorrect table layout are a few that comes to mind.   Staff were clearly inexperienced and didn't live up to the star class expectations.   Here's hoping that they will pull their act together and deliver what the customer pays to gain.
