This was a family trip for the four of us and like before each such trip I contacted the GM to check on a few things.  My email exchange with GM Manesh Fernando turned out to be quite pleasant.  I am Honors Gold and the status was recognized.  We were immediately confirmed for a very early check-in (around 6 AM), got upgraded to a corner suite and even had an extra roll-away placed in our room.  I was a bit surprised to know that they didn’t have a kids club or the sort, while direct access to the pool side via the bridge was off during our stay.

We start our travels in Sri Lanka from this hotel, staying here 2 or 3 times a year.  It is handy for money exchange and local shops.  The staff are always friendly and welcoming from opening the car door to closing it when you depart.  The rooms are comfortable if a little dated but everything we need is there.  When there is time for a swim the pool is clean and welcoming.  The pool attendants are always helpful in moving sunbeams around to search for shady spots.  It would be helpful if there were sun umbrellas close to the sun beds rather than only around the tables, though.

From the time I arrived at the hotel, I found the staff courteous and helpful in all aspects.  What most impressed me what they continual and consistent friendliness every time I arrived at the hotel, came down for breakfast, or departed.  This was also the time of the coronavirus, and all hotel personnel wore masks for protection.  This concern did not detract from their service to ensure that all of my needs were seen to.  The facilities are fine, but what sets this hotel apart from all others is their attention to their clients.

It seems the concierge do not know how to take simple request.",Date of stay: February 2020Cardiardaith,Central Colombo stop-over before touring Sri Lanka,"Good location in old fort district with intetesting historical buildings and close to Fort Train Station - a five minute walk but a busy, dense traffic route with uneven pavements if you have luggage so a taxi preferrable.  Old Dutch Hospital opposite has good eating places if you don't want to eat at hotel.  Agree with reviews that say rooms are a bit dated, noisy air con and not quite 5 star but have to commend the pool area and the gardens and the excellent Executive Lounge with charming service.  As a Gold Hilton Hons Member we were given an upgrade to Exec level and allocated a room on arrival at 8am after a long flight without additional charge.

Restaurant food is good for breakfast and dinner and once again waiting staff are just amazing.  Unfortunately the rooms are just a little 'tired and worn'.

The lobby area and Executive Lounge have recently been upgraded and it shows--elegance. One of the most important issues in this hotel is the location of your room---if you are in the area of room 1 it is very noisy and in 25 a great pleasure. Rooms are pleasant but bathrooms are very old. The Executive Lounge is a delightful restful area where the staff are very kind under the care of a most professional hotelier --KRIS the manager. The swimming pool area is far from the main hotel requiring you to walk across the road using a bridge.

But the rooms and beds are very clean and comfortable, which remains to be Hilton's great level of service.   The breakfast spread is vast and awesome....my favourite was the Sri Lankan dishes which include stringhoppers, egg hoppers, idli, dhal, po sambol etc. And there were also the western spread of eggs, bacon, baked beans and toast, and there was a section serving Chinese dishes e.g. dimsum and noodles. I could go on and on about the breakfast spread.  Had the dinner buffet on our final night there and at a price of LKR2,500 oer person, the spread was awesome. There were Sri Lankan dishes comprising curry and fresh seafood, Western meals of steak and pasta, and free flow of juices.",Date of stay: January 2020SoozG,convenient location,"+ Beautiful hotel grounds.     Walking distance to dutch hospital though I wish the hotel had warned me that men on the street, not just around the hotel, would strike conversation, about working in the hotel, being an off duty police officer or tour operator, or with some sob story about tsunami victims and try to convince me to get into a tuktuk. DO NOT SPEAK TO PEOPLE ON THE STREET. Sad when you have like to get to know locals but these ones are after your money.   food really delicious. - the pool, gym and spa are on the other side of a road and accessible via a bridge.    gym looks dated   spa is a huge disappointment: Not to Hilton standard.

Our Executive room was large and had a view of the pool and water. Executive lounge access was included - this is quite basic with soft drinks, tea and coffee provided throughout the day along with minimal snacks and fruit. Between 6-8pm they serve canapés and alcohol. Pool is a short stroll from hotel but not too onerous and whilst we were there was very quiet. Breakfast buffet substantial with loads of variety.

We both agreed  the bed was the most comfortable of all of the hotels we tried in Sri Lanka, and so that was a nice treat!

There is no limit to how much you eat so it is very good value. We chose it for our last night in Sri Lanka and weren't disappointed.

Having eaten in restaurants in other hotels in Colombo, and stayed at another business hotel here, the thing that sets the Hilton apart is the staff - they are warm and friendly and genuinely care about your experience with them at every point, from the door staff and front desk to the restaurants and room service. Nothing is too much effort and everything is always done with a smile.

One of the touches I always appreciate and often overlooked in hotels is the make up mirrors in the bathrooms.

At breakfast, they introduce themselves and get you what you want. I really like freshly squeezed orange juice. They got me just that. Across the road at Kingsbury, they want me to pay extra for it when I was already paying US$200+ a night! At Hilton Colombo, they didn't care about the small change.

Why in the 21st century smoking is permitted anywhere inside a hotel is beyond me; as is the inability of hotel doors to close quietly. There is construction noise on-going, which can be irritating if working in the rooms.

The hotel has been undergoing some construction in the lobby area for more than a year but it is very presentable and they put up walls around the area being worked on so if you did not know what it looked like before you may not even notice it was under construction because the temporary structure is so nice and looks permanent.

If you were in Colombo on business or if you're doing what we were doing, you'll be more than comfortable.  The area around the hotel is OK as well.  You're close to a ""beach"", and there are a few dinning options around.  This was simply an OK hotel for the cost.

Shady exchange rate practices and outdated for a Hilton.,"Stayed here 2 times, 2 nights basically because I am a Diamond member and because it is walking distance to Fort Train Station (10-15 mins). Check in was chaotic due to the renovation and tons of Chinese tour groups and businessmen hogging the counter. Really annoyed by the game they play with exchange rates. Posting rates in USD, then using an inflated exchange rate to charge your card that will make it 5% or so more expensive. Why do they feel the need to do this? Do they consider their guests stupid? Choose to pay in USD always. Executive lounge was cramped and food mediocre. Rooms are OK, but a bit outdated. It is an older Hilton, and you will sleep well. That's about it.",Date of stay: March 2016Jamal A,A great place to stay in Colombo,Have been there numerous times. Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful.

Currently only one restaurant open, but that's a shadow of its former self. Yes there is a Italian restaurant by the pool, but that to me doesn't count as somewhere one would want to eat.  Reception staff continue to be slow, not understanding that the local entity I work for has covered the room fees, so check in and check out takes 30 minutes.  Still very convenient hotel close to the World Trade Centre, but as my company has moved elsewhere, we will not be staying at the Hilton until the renovations are complete.",Date of stay: February 2016clickgal,Old rooms - good service,The hotel is completely outdated!

The rooms were spacious, had superb views, were clean and tidy, and whilst not 'brand new' had a distinct charm to them.  As has been reported in many Tripadvisor reports recently the hotel is undergoing refurbishment, which is currently effecting much of the entrance area and ground floor, but I'm sure once completed (we were told a month or so for the ground floor) will be hugely impressive.   The works at the moment really didn't effect our stay in any way as the concierge team welcomed us most professionally at the front door when we arrived by taxi, moving us quickly through to reception past the ongoing works where we were booked in",Date of stay: March 2016Vamadeva B,Pleasant Stay,The asset of the hotel is definitely the excellent well trained staff.

The rooms are very good, with lovely views of the city and beach, but are a little tired in places compared with the best Hiltons.    The staff are very welcoming and friendly, after a couple of days they will probably know your name despite the size of the hotel.  There are the usual facilities - executive lounge, a decent gym and a pool.  The restaurants are very good, and get rated amongst the better places to eat in Colombo.  The only downside is the current refurb works (as of late March) which significantly restricts the size of the reception area and the dining areas.  It does not seem to be noisy and the staff work very well",Date of stay: March 2016Sri S,Privacy is not a priority for the staff,"Privacy is not something the Hilton Colombo takes seriously.

I'm not sure as to what one should do to make the staff understand that privacy is actually thing the customers require.  The duty manager who received the complaint assured that they will not forward calls from outside, but the calls kept coming.  It seems the the front-office and the telephone-operator don't communicate and share privacy requirement.",Garry B,A great hotel with great staff makes staying at the Hilton Colombo a pleasurable experience,The Hilton Colombo is the finest hotel in Sri-Lanka.

I believe the Hilton Colombo is one of the finest 5 star hotels in Sri-Lanka / Asia because it has an old style warmth of charm and sophistication. The staff just can't do enough for the guest.

The pool was accessed by crossing a bridge over a busy road. This lovely pool area is right next to a building site and a railway. Sounds horrendous but it was so peaceful, clean and calm away from the busy streets of Colombo. The exec floor was sometimes occupied  by groups of showy business types and it was like a call centre with all the 'fab' rings tones going off and then calls being answered using the ""important"" voice.

The gym is very well equipped. I had a suite overlooking downtown and the Beira Lake. I could see the ocean past the port. The best views are on ocean side though my views were quiet good.

Hilton Colombo has long history and thus the building is a bit old, and not as luxurious as their recent new versions of hotels. But Hilton is still a hilton and you get good service and rooms are pretty nice, also the view is pretty good as you look at the coastline and surrounding buildings. They're renovating so gym/spa area was separated from the main building and you take a shuttle to reach it. It was a bit hassle though it only takes about 3 minutes to get there.

So I insisted she tried the credit card again, and thankfully it worked. So it wasn't a fault with my card, but Hilton's machine, almost leaving me being unable to check in.

So one can safely say that this is a good place to be in.,Bufgub,Excellent staff,This is my hotel of choice in Colombo. From the moment you check in to the moment you leave you are treated as a valued customer and the staff can't do enough for you.  Rooms overlooking the ocean treat you to a spectacular view which is just heavenly to wake up to. Rooms themselves are a good size but are getting a bit tired in decor. I am very much looking forward to seeing the results of the renovation that commences shortly.  Food and drink options abound and there are a choice of restaurants. My favourite is Spoons which offers fine dining in a relaxed and informal atmosphere. If you fancy venturing out the new Dutch Hospital complex is opposite and offers a great choice of eateries.

I have grown to like this hotel and wonder where I will stay next year!  Transfer - I took the hotel transfers from the airport and we used the new highway. Incredible time saving BUT make sure you tell the driver to take the new highway and he will ask you to pay the 300 rupee toll.

This second visit didn't match my experiences of the first visit.    The room was smaller, much older furniture and bedding/towels, and very used carpet.     I had to leave before breakfast was available, so the hotel kindly offered a breakfast box.     That was so-so quality of a sandwich, juice, apple, and two rolls.   But it was a nice gesture.    I'll give it another try on my next visit to Colombo-- and will hopefully have a better experience.    My first visit was much better... so it clearly depends on the room.

Moreover, the hotel itself is akin to a mini-resort, with live entertainment, an excellent pool bar vibe, delicious food (including one of the best hotel breakfast buffets on the island, and a seafood buffet that is, by night, one of Colombo's finest restaurants), all set upon beautifully groomed, if not compact, grounds.

Prices are reasonable. Overall the hotel has a nice pleasant feel.  The lounge bar has an ok atmosphere, nothing great but sadly the bands they have here are not that good, so much so that I think it actually drives guests away at times.  Cleanliness here is very good. I stay in the suites with 2 rooms. Linen very clean and nice big comfortable beds. Lots of space in the room. The big let down is that they have aircon in the living room area but nothing in the bedroom so it gets rather hot which is very frustrating. The aircon is also quite old so struggles to keep the living room area cool. My other negative comment is the TV's are the very old small Cathode Ray TVs from about 20 years ago. For a",Date of stay: August 2013tholland55,Pleasant stay,"The staff in this hotel certainly make up for its deficiencies as they provide such good service from the moment you arrive until the moment you leave. The rooms could do with a refurbishment as they are starting to look their age and the Internet service is very, very  slow. They also need to replace their televisions with flat screens as the existing ones are pretty ordinary. The rest of the hotel is fine in terms of room size and cleanliness. Every staff member I dealt with was professional and helpful which made the stay enjoyable. The Executive Lounge was very good and the staff there very service oriented. Would have liked to have stayed longer.",Date of stay: July 2013922Steve,"Not the 'Best', but makes up for it","I have stayed at this hotel many times in the 6 years, It is true that it is not the best Hilton property in the world, mainly because the room fit out is very old and desperately in need of refurbishment (as of May 2013).  However, there are some excellent features of this hotel that more than make of for the shortcomings.  First of all, the staff, trained to Hilton standards, are the best of any '5 star' hotel in Colombo.  I know, because I have stayed at them all, and none come close to the competence of the Hilton staff.  My guess is that the Hilton management maybe also treats their staff better, because they certainly seem happier than at other hotels.  Like any Hilton property, the food is great.  The buffet restaurant offers a wide range of local, regional and",Date of stay: May 2013606SamS,HILTON CMB doing its to be on par with world wide HH standards.,"Hilton Colombo which started its operations in the mid 80s is the 2nd CMB hotel frequented by my self.   The Hotel is startegically located in the heart of the CMB between the World Trade Center and Galadari Colombo. The hotel is a shout away from most of the Banks including the Central Bank of SL.  Do to the low occupency the Check in very smooth at this Hotel, where the max waiting time would be 15 mins on a 60+ occupency day. The rooms are old with worn out carpets. The Bell boys do a super service and profeassional enough to accept only our smiles in return for their gleeming local smiles......  The Room amneties include the normal HH basics with a local touch. The Thorana Lounge which is in the far left of the lobby acts as the tea spot of the hotel and it serves excellent",Date of stay: June 2013Sanjeewa A,Excellent Wedding Reception,Yesterday we attended a well organized Wedding Reception at the Hilton. This was professionally handled. Quality of the food was excellent and food was very well seasoned. Staff was very attentive except for one staff member spilt the lime juice to her clothes. Overall would like to Congratulate the Hilton for the wonderful job done.,Date of stay: June 2013Rapz83,Hilton It Is...,"We stayed here for about 3 days and it was wonderful.The room was superb, very luxurious and comfortable.Lovely scenic view. The staff was friendly and very helpful.Room service was nice. But we tried 2 of their restauratns and sad to say didn't enjoy either.Specialy the Japanese one.It was an utter dissapointment! The buffet at the Spices restaurant was really below average.Dining expectations are high in this type of hotels, therefore I think they have to improve their standards. Also the high tea wasn't upto standard(with very limited varieties) specialy compaired to other 5 star hotels.But was very relaxing in the grand lobby while listening to x'mas carols. Nevertheless the stay was wonderful , looking forward to staying here again.",Date of stay: December 2012gehararigo,,,manderjones,A stay of smiles,"I rocked up to the five-star Hilton Colombo in a rickshaw from Gard du Fort railway station just a stones throw away and was welcomed by the front desk and porters with open smiles and clemency. During my visit the hotel had plans to renovate the slightly tired looking rooms. In spite of this, the service and huge Christmas tree in the front lobby made it a magical and memorable experience. Staff went out of their way to ensure comfort and enjoyment and the concierge was unobtrusively talkative and helpful. As evening swung round, live entertainment was laid on in tune with the sophistication and elegance this hotel has to offer. For service and smiles this is the best hotel I've come across to date.",Date of stay: December 2012Veronique1702,,,schneeeflocke,Great hotel in the middle of Colombo,"Professional, very helpful and friendly staff. Hotel is perfectly situated. Nice outdoor pool area. Close to the ocean, the train station and the fort quarter.  Great panoramic windows in all guest rooms with few onto the ocean, lake or religious monument.",obscene,Great location with the Best serive,"Rooms were fantastic and great for business trips.  Internet available in rooms but no wifi.  Great location, was able to go running on the beach in the morning and over look the beautiful gardens while having breakfast.  Dining outside in the evening with some of the best seafood I have ever tried.  The reception staff even took me on a quick tour of the city sites on a rickshaw in his own time, the staff were so friendly and helpful!",Date of stay: June 2012Bjorn A,Great Hotel and service,"For short or long - business or leisure - this hotel is a great place to be while being in Colombo. Very friendly and service minded staff, great service and the interior of the hotel, including rooms are excellent. We stayed on the 14th floor - fantastic view towards the city with Galle Face in front. The beds - well, could not have slept any better, VERY comfy. We did never go down for the breakfast, - too early for us at this trip ;) but in room dining is great and the food excellent. We definitely recommend Hilton Colombo.",Adrian L,"Friendly staff, but definitely time for a major renovation","I have recently stayed here for two days and am very impressed with the service level of the staffs - everyone from the front desk, the executive lounge, the bell desk, the housekeeping staffs and to the restaurants can't be kinder and make an effort to take good care of you.  The hotel has definitely seen better days and from what I gather, they are in the midst of renovating, which is definitely needed.  The room is spacious and the bed is comfortable, despite the decoration is fairly dated, and it is hard to imagine that flatscreen TVs are not used.  Wifi is working okay and I am fairly happy with the room.  There are various restaurants in the hotel and you really don't need to go outside.  I bought a package that includes dinner in the Spices restaurant, but was",Date of stay: May 2013SamAndSheena,What an evening!,"The rooms of-course, are wonderful, especially the Junior Suites, but this review is about the Lobby Lounge, where they have live music every evening, from about 7 PM to around Midnight.  The Hilton somehow manages to find really very entertaining bands, who play lovely music, take requests, etc.  Having a few drinks, and perhaps some bites, while listening, or even dancing to the vibrant music here at the Hilton Hotel Lobby Lounge (Thorana Lounge) is a real pleasure and an enjoyable addition to any holiday in Sri Lanka!",Date of stay: April 2013darre77,In need of a major major update,"You expect a Hilton hotel in 2012 but get a 1980s Hilton experience instead. Bathed in various tacky coloured lights, this Hilton sorely lacks the sophistication or modernity of any Hilton hotel built in this millennium.  The rooms are also poor appointed and feel grubby. Sheets aren't clean and soft but feel worn and starchy. Admittedly this could really be the best Colombo has to offer for now. It honestly needs a major renovation and an overhaul of service to bring it into alignment with the Hilton standard across the rest of the world.  Am headed back to Sri Lanka this year and am hoping the Shangri-La will be completed in time so that I won't need to stay in this hotel again.",Date of stay: October 2012Abdulla S,Excellence in Business,"Over may stay at Colombo Hilton was very satisfied due to the quality of accommodation, the food served and the friendliness of the staff. I was particularly impressed by Colombo Hilton's late or extended check out policy and the concierge services.",Devpal M,Stay in Hilton Colombo,"It was good stay , the rooms are nice and so is service levels of the staff . However the property gives a feel of old and outdated .. The televisions are pre historic and some of the gadgets are old .... so need a quick change",dyoll,Good location,"Good service, some rooms with great views (get a room as high up as possible), and a good location at the Fort next to World Trade Centre (the location shown on the TA site map is completely wrong!) and close to Fort station and the bazaar. The entrance and lobby area are impressive and there are several shops and restaurants. Swimming pool across a bridge on other side of road. My room was reasonably sized but with only one king size bed. The room however was dated and in need of refurbishing - bathrooms in particular with peeling and mould discoloured wallpaper. Several things didn't work - plug on iron was burned, light in wardrobe difficult to turn off, one telephone not working. Poor security - there is no restriction on persons using the lifts. I'd probably stay here again",Date of stay: April 2013ishdesilva,Excellent hotel in Sri Lanka,"I stayed in Hilton colombo several times for past couple of years and this is one of my favourite hotels in sri lanka.

We selected Hilton so that we can expect the quality expected from Hilton.  However, we were disappointed.  The first impression was really shocking.  The front office staff had coats 3 sizes bigger, very shabby and also very old.  The rooms are quite ordinary and nothing said ""Hilton Class"".  The tariff however was Hilton Class!  SO absolutely no value for money  The breakfast was good with good spread for Indians from Idli, Dosa, Appams, Upma etc,   The continental spread was also quite good and of quality standards  Location is terrific.

I feel miserable because I have just been ripped off for paying 1 star hotel a 5 star rate.   Too tired to describe the disaster this hotel is - even the staff are dressed in 20 yr old uniforms that  need refurbishment - forget the hotel.
