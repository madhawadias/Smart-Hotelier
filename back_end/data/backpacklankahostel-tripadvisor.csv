Niyas was awesome and couldn’t do enough for us.  He helped us plan our route of Sri Lanka, telling us the best places to go and ways to get there.  The room itself was basic but clean and the air-con was good. The walls are very thin so you can clearly hear noise from your neighbours. The shared bathrooms were clean and had hot water.  Breakfast included fried eggs, toast and tea or coffee.   Location wise, there is a food court within walking distance, a mall across the road with a coffee shop inside and around 20-30 minutes walk to galle face green.

The success of the hostel is definitely its staff, especially Niyas. Both him and the boys are super friendly and will go out of their way to give advice, help arrange trips, sighseeing etc. Niyas was especially generous with his time and personal recommendations, he actually sat down with us for about an hour to tell us all about Sri Lanka's highlights.

When I came to check out, I said I didn't want to pay for the first night due to the bites and scars on my arms.  The guy was really rude and told me it wasn't his problem but mine that there were bedbugs.  Apparently if you want to avoid them then you should stay in one of the double rooms.

Very average hostel and not bad as long as you know what you're letting yourself in for.   The good: The room has AC. Room and toilet were clean. Free breakfast. Felt secure and safe. A good central base for accessing many areas in Colombo via cheap tuk tuk or bus. Helpful staff. Near to ATMs and supermarket. Has communal areas, kitchens and pool table. Our room, unlike the majority, did have windows. We had an ensure toilet and shower.  The bad: Next to very busy road so very loud, even at night. Cupboards and pillows smelled very musty. No bedding provided other than a sheet on the mattress and pillow unless you ask for it (which you will need to as AC makes room cold and it's not adaptable.) Some small ants on one",Date of stay: July 2017Daniel A,Much better choices in Colombo,"We stayed in a private room for 1 night and overall the stay was uncomfortable and the worst place we stayed in Colombo. The receptionist sleeps downstairs in front of the fridge which was a bit awkward when we were trying to reach the drinks we had in there during the night. Maybe he should sleep to the side of the room.  Location: Good location and close to lots of different amenities. There is a supermarket just next door which is convenient and the hostel isn't far from the station either.  Service: Very bad. Firstly the receptionist short changed us when we bought some drinks and acted as if he hadn't. Secondly, he refused to give another pillow. The pillows are extremely small so it was very uncomfortable to use. Apparently, they do not have any spares.  Room: No windows",Date of stay: June 2017Muslaki,Worth for a night,"Hot water was super nice.

The bathrooms weren't cleaned either day we were there and were quite smelly. The staff were really nice so it's a bit of a shame the place was so dirty. I don't mind places being a bit run down when they're cheap but I just think there's no excuse for it to be dirty. The free breakfast was good if you like spicy food!

The front desk service is fantastic, so friendly.  We were helped with putting together an itinerary for our whole trip and it made a huge difference.  Lots of advice, friendly tips, and it's close to some great local restaurants where you can try authentic food for cheap.  Perfect for a short stay, which is most likely all you'll need in Colombo as the real beauty in Sri Lanka is elsewhere.  But it was great!  I'd stay again, just for the 5-star service!

They were extremely helpful when my husband lost his passport and had to stay longer than planned.  The manager went of his way to help in anyway possible, which made the crisis that little bit more bearable.

The manager Brinley was always keen for a chat and on Friday night they were kind enough to provide free drinks to a group of us staying at the hostel. They then took us for a night out. With a group of over 10 of us it was a fantastic night.  Only negative comment I'll make is that the dorm bunks are ridiculous noisy. Like I couldn't move my arm without an almighty creak.

It is rather far from downtown but near to the National Museum and somewhat close to the two big malls in the city.  This has a younger party vibe and the lobby and lounge serves beer and has very loud music some nights.  You won't get much sleep before midnight.  The fastest way to get here from the airport or train station is by taxi, but you can also walk to or from the nearby Kullupitiya suburban train station.  if you are at the main Colombo station, you can look for the booths in the corner of the station towards the city center with suburban destinations and buy a very cheap ticket two stops to Kollupitiya.
