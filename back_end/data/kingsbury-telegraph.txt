\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 The Kingsbury is well located for wining and dining as it\'92s situated at the northern end of the Galle Face Green and just 100 metres from the Dutch Hospital (home to Ministry of Crab and outlets of Odel and Spa Ceylon). However, thanks to the ongoing land reclamation project for the capital\'92s 269-hectare Port City Colombo development (25 years in the making), its direct sea views have been replaced with a Gulf-like expanse of sand trolled over by construction vehicles. You can still see the sea beyond it, though, and all down the Galle Face Green. The hotel is one of Colombo\'92s longest standing. It was formerly known as the Ceylon Intercontinental but refurbished and rebranded as The Kingsbury in 2012. Although the restaurants, rooftop, rooms and interiors have all been brought up to date, the hotel still feels a touch dated, mostly due to its carpeted rooms, narrow corridors and traditional style. The hotel is a popular weddings and events venue, and the food outlets are patronised by local residents, so the lobby and public areas often get quite busy, (particularly at weekends).\
The staff are friendly, attentive and welcoming. Those at the front desk can help arrange city tours while the housekeeping team are particularly prompt in dealing with requests. The hotel has a ground-floor swimming pool, a gym with steam room and sauna, and a spa.\
The rooms are traditionally styled, carpeted and offer views down the Galle Face Green, of the ocean or north towards the port. The standard rooms have king-sized or twin beds, floor-to-ceiling windows and compact grey marble bathrooms with showers. Rooms are well equipped with minibars, robes and slippers, wall-mounted televisions and Bulgari toiletries in the bathooms. Beds are adorned with Frette linen and are comfortable (if you don\'92t mind a soft mattress). Grab a room on a higher floor (they\'92re slightly more expensive) and opt for a Galle Face Green view, or go for a larger Premier Room, which has a bigger bathroom and panoramic views.\

\cf2 The breakfast buffet is a generous spread on the ground floor of the hotel, and offers plenty of Sri Lankan and Western options: some salads, chunkily chopped fruit and pastries, as well as\'a0dhal,\'a0spicy sambols,\'a0coconut roti and\'a0
\f1\i appa\'a0
\f0\i0 (bowl-shaped fermented rice flour pancakes). There are also a few live cooking stations.\
On the top floor is Ce La Vi, a rooftop bar and restaurant. It has superb views looking south down the Galle Face Green, making it ideal for sundowners, and serves a huge range of cocktails. The Asian fusion restaurant adjacent to it is smart and the staff very attentive; the food is good value. Beside the pool is an Italian restaurant and bar, and there\'92s also a Chinese restaurant and sports bar.\
