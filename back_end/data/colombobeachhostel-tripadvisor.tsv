WayneB1990,Great place,"Nice little place, rooms are basic but clean and have everything you need. Staff are very friendly. The kitchen area could do with improving. Great location a few minutes walk to the beach, much nicer than staying in central Colombo.",Date of stay: January 2020

Emilia and Johann,Nice and helpful Staff,"The food in the restaurant was good and at a reasonable price and the Staff was very friendly and helpful. The only downside is, that, even though the beach is close, we felt unconfortable to go in the water in bikini, as there were only men and it felt weird, being the only woman",Date of stay: October 2019
daxstutz,"Unreasonable, Rude, Greedy Manager","I stayed here when the hostel was completely empty, and decided to shorten my stay.  The manager absolutely refused to allow me to shorten it, and insisted I pay for an extra 2 nights that I would not even be staying (even though the place was literally empty so there's zero chance I was taking away the opportunity for other customers to stay). He was rude, unreasonable, and downright greedy.  The neighbourhood is also rather unsafe. I had someone threaten me on the beach and shake me down for money.   I will say the staff is very kind, it's just a shame the manager is such an unreasonable man. Avoid this place, if you can.",Date of stay: October 2019
Carmen M,Excellent place,"I enjoyed my time at this hostel. It was very clean, the staff was super, and the roof top with sofas, kitchen and garden was a plus. I even stayed at their other hostels.  The owner helped me to arrange and plan other destinations in Sri Lanka and left me keep my bag at the hostel for free while I toured the country. I highly recommend this place.",Date of stay: September 2019
Charlotte F,Hidden Away Hostel in Mt. Lavinia,My favorite things about this hostel were the rooftop and the staff. The kitchen on the roof meant I could cook my own food when I felt like it (healthy choices and saving money) and the common space there was relaxing and beautiful. Dorms were basic but comfortable. Travis and Shiromi and Dinesh were wonderful hosts. They helped my with whatever I needed and gave me lots of good info and travel tips for my time in Sri Lanka. The hostel was very close to the beach and I walked there every day. Easy bus ride into Colombo city.,Date of stay: September 2019
Julien M,Sooooo nice !!!,"Top place, top team & top terrace ! The Barnes Garden Cafe provides you a big choice of food/drinks, delicious and cheap. Don’t hesitate to go there ! Thanks again Denish & your team for your welcoming ! Julien & Maxime from Belgium ____",Date of stay: September 2019
Mizundahstood,Terrible service,"Horrible neighborhood, and terrible service... Staff was NOT helpful and safety was questionable. Had a terrible experience being a solo traveller and the neighborhood was shady and I didn't feel at all safe.",Date of stay: October 2019
Emily,VERY DIRTY!!,Sadly really dirty beds and all quite run down! The building is old so everything is a little dusty and the beds were a real overcoming to sleep in.   Go to lavinia beach hostel if youre looking for a clean nice stay!,Date of stay: August 2019
Aussie Shane,"Friendly Staff, Cool Rooftop","I stayed at the Colombo Beach Hostel for 4dayd while i explored Colombo. The staff were so hospitable and helpful. I arrived at 2am and the Manager woke up and kindly opened the locked gate and accommodated me. The rooms are clean and comfortable. It is well located, making it convenient to travel to the city and train staion. Will definitely return.",Date of stay: April 2019
Phantom s,Stay away,"Where do I start. Okay full disclosure, here goes. I am Sri Lankan and I came to Colombo and wanted a place to stay for one night, before I headed to India the following day, so I came to this place which honestly by the looks of it wasn't that special, gave me the impression that this was one of those typical hostels where people started it just because everyone else is doing it in Sri Lanka. It's a trend thing. When one person has a bit of success with a hostel, everyone in Sri lanka wants a piece of that pie. Anyways, so I came and asked the old man whose was at the desk whether I can stay for one night and if their are any dorms available? To which he responded saying yes and assumed I was Indian and asked me ""are you from India""?(typical Sri Lanka mindset), naturally I",Date of stay: March 2019
Jakob,Vacation,Really nice place!  Good chilliing area on the roof nice vibes and so close to the beach.  Price value is perfect and the staff is just super friendly and really welcoming.  Bandara is best man always good to chill with and will do everything to make you happy!!,Date of stay: February 2019
Stroopwafel53,A great place to stay in Colombo!,"I stayed here twice for two days each time and had a great experience. Beds and bathrooms are good but the highlight is the wonderful rooftop terrace where I usually got to know other guests in the evening over a beer, good talks or a game of cards. It is also very close to the beach. The staff was super nice and helps you to plan your time in Sri Lanka with great recommendations. While you cannot eat food from the hostel there is a very good (although slightly expensive) pizzeria on the ground floor and many restaurants are on the main street nearby. Will come back if I'm in Colombo again!",Date of stay: December 2018
Natalierosefearn,Okay for one night,The rooftop social area was good and the location to the beach. However there was a rat and red ants in the kitchen and the private room only had a fan whilst the dorm rooms had A/C even though the private room was more expensive.,Date of stay: March 2019
Kris_Toor,Great place,"This place has everything that one can ask from a hostel, but the most important it has the staff. I booked one night I ended up staying like 6 nights. In low season they are super flexible so if at 5 pm suddenly you decide that you want to sty they will welcome you with open arms. I booked 8 people room it was full got free upgrade to 4 people, and the second time even ac 6 people alone room coz no one was there. When I came i felt like at family home! They all will ask you how are you what did you do and ho was your day. In common area on the rooftop you can always get interesting people. Must stay in Mt. Lavinia",Date of stay: January 2019
Raghu V,Great hostel with great price,My first visit to srilanka and staying in this hostel my very first day made my entire srilanka trip very awesome.. The host bandaru was amazing and super chilled.. I can say this is the best hostel with amazing rooftop and very closer to mount lavinia beach..,Date of stay: December 2018
benjamin c,Very good hostel,"It’s was a very nice hostel, clean and cheap. Also you have a kitchen available, you can cook your own food. Bandara is very friendly and awesome man . He is always here to help you, for your traveling or for another question. he is also amazing cookers , you can cook with him and learn Sri Lanka dishes . I recommend this hostel in Colombo.",Date of stay: December 2018

Jan H,Colombo beach hostel and Kandy city view,"I stayed in both the above hostels. They have a small chain with another one south of Galle and offer a reduction if you're moving on. Fantastic sociable way to meet people. Rooms were great. Nice breakfast optional extra. Use of kitchen facilities. Very clean, but above all were the hard working friendly staff. If I had one fault it would the total lack of time off for these guys who even give up their beds for unexpected travellers. I think the owner should take note ..... Good staff are hard to come by, so, more time off and a bonus please boss!",Date of stay: February 2018
MTB-Worldwide,Budget hotel close to the beach,"If you need to be close to the city and next to a beach then Mt Lavinia is the place to be! Colombo Beach Hostel is a budget hotel 5 minutes walk from the beach. The rooms are basic, but clean and big and the roof top is a nice place to chill out in the sun or under shade. Plenty of places close by right on the beach front to eat at.",Date of stay: January 2018
lubie_placki,Not cool,"The hostel is alright, standard for a price. Close to the beach  (albeit the beach itself it not that great) but if you come to Colombo only for a day, it's pretty far away from the city/bus station/airport.  Staff seemed nice, but my main issue is that I left a personal item (of small value actually) on my bunk bed when I checked out and noticed that only on my way to another city. I quickly messaged them whether they found out but they ""did not"". In the dorm room there were only my friends so none of them took it for sure.  Kind of sad that they ""could not find it"".   So just be careful with your stuff at the property.",Date of stay: January 2018
ecmf27,"Clean, tidy, friendly",Clean and tidy room. We stayed in a 4 bed (2 bunk bed) ensuite room for one night before travelling on (plenty for us in Colombo). The staff were all friendly and helpful and happy to point us in the right direction and sort tuktuks etc.,Date of stay: January 2018
jumaanimerawi,right on the beach,"clean hostel, great atmosphere and the bloke that runs the show (rod) is a legend.  we had rooftop for chills with good kitchen attached. no sketchy dogs in the ally ways that surround the hostel so no fear of being bitten by a mongrel dog.  Happy days :)  lots of love jumaa and alex from aus.",Date of stay: December 2017
Erik v,Overall nice,"The rooftop bar is really nice and the location 100 meters from the beach. Beds are fine (dorm room for 8 people). Breakfast is basic (not included), but good if you don't want to search for  something else. Overall good for money.",Date of stay: December 2017
Sean_higgins1996,Awesome hostel!,"Great hostel to stay at for sure, great vibes in the common area on rooftop, clean everywhere throughout the hostel. Cooking facilities are good, staff are friendly and very helpful. Will definitely recommend this place to friends.",Date of stay: December 2017
Amy A,"Lovely, welcoming hostel","Me and a friend stayed here as our first stop in Sri Lanka for 2 nights. The manager was very friendly and the volunteers were super helpful. The hostel was clean, well-equipped (the free coffee was a life saver) and fun to stay at. The roof terrace made it for us, really cool hang out place where we met the other travellers in the hostel.   The only con is that the area is a little boring, mainly hotels and main roads. The beach wasn't the best either, but the hostel was the perfect place to hang out and acclimatise.",Date of stay: November 2017
michaela j,Awesome!,"Spent my first few days in Sri Lanka in there and then came back for my last 2 days as I loved it so much!   Colombo beach hostel is a really nice hostel in Mount Lavinia a few meters from the beach. The rooms are nice, there's free coffe&tea&filtered water, good wifi and amazing rooftop where you can hang out and meet fellow travellers.   Dinesh, owner and Rodney, manager are so nice and welcoming that you feel at home straight away. They are great to talk to and help you plan your perfect stay in Sri Lanka. The hostel has its sister hostels in Kandy and Mirissa, I have visited both of them and can strongly reccommend them all :)   In the evenings we would have these amazing cooking classes with Rodney where he would show us how to prepare real Sri Lankan food like rice&curry,",Date of stay: November 2017
matthiasboxheimer,"A home, far away from home","We stood there for two nights and were really happy. They have an shuttle from the airport, the rooms are clean and the stuff is helpful. To sit on the rooftopterrace and have a beer was great. Really high recommendable",Date of stay: September 2017
loralorent,Basic AF but owner very welcoming and wonderful rooftop terrace makes it all worth it,"I had a layover in Sri Lanka so utilised it by exploring the city. I arrived later at night to the hostel than anticipated, and Michael the owner had upgraded my room for free as the dorm I'd picked was overbooked. If it was indeed upgraded, I hate to think what the dorm I picked looked like. Room was great, spacious but very basic, and I was so lucky to be the only person in there as it was sweltering so I had the only fan aimed directly at me all night and it was still muggy as. Didn't have any problems with any mosquitos however. Shower was cold but you seriously don't want a hot or even warm shower in those rooms let alone the whole of Sri Lanka. Michael was so wonderful and really made me feel safe and welcome. The roof top terrace is the kicker! Would 100% recommend this",Date of stay: May 2017
true s,Friendly stuff,"The hostel stuff is friendlyand the hostel is very close to the beach and you have many possibilities to find food what ever you like. The room is ok not the cleanest but allright for the cheap prices. The bad thing is you have no real night life for tourists and it is quite dangerous at night to walk around. But if you look for a cheap price its ok. The roof top is very nice and chilled, but there a lot of mosqitos flying around.",Date of stay: April 2017
Laura D,Very basic,"We stayed here two nights at the beginning of our trip. The rooms and facilities are very basic. The bedding was dirty, the pillows needed to be replaced, and we were only provided with one sheet. The bathroom also had cockroaches. The dorm room with a fan is uncomfortably warm at night and there are lots of mosquitos. However, the location is great and they do have a nice common area on the roof. Overall, for budget travellers this place is great. However, if you have extra money to spend I would recommend going somewhere more comfortable.",Date of stay: March 2017
Yoare,Okay place!,"Stayed here for one night on the day of my arrival in Sri Lanka. Really basic hostel, okay for one night. Stayed in a mixed dorm, feels a bit old but was clean. Bed was okay but you need mosquito net which is there. Bathroom and toilet really basic. They have a community kitchen and lounge on the rooftop. Management was friendly. It's about 1 hour drive from airport cost +/- 15 euro. Location is good, near beach, plenty of restaurants and supermarkets and near train station, so easy if you want to go south.",Date of stay: February 2017
Pankti Shah,A mesmerizing place to stay,"This is one of the best hostels to stay for backpackers as you can have a perfect start to your exploration of Sri Lanka. Amenities such as beach restaurants, bars, banks and coffee shops are located within a very close proximity.   A best place to have a relaxing time unwind with new friends.",Date of stay: June 2016
Bernard M,No top bed sheet?,Only bed sheet to cover mattress. Shower was Luke warm at best. Facilities were clean and tidy. Well kept. Receive a page of things to do in the area on arrival as well which helps. The kicker here is the rooftop kitchen area where you can make yourself food/drink and socialise with other guests. Was a great atmosphere and really relaxing to spend time up there.,Date of stay: January 2017
Theres H,4 night at the hostel,"We arrived in the middle of the night, there was only a boy in the ""reception"" who didn't speak English. He had problems to find our booking. After awhile he went to get his father, I presume. He find the booking, but it was registered on wrong name. The room was okey, it had a fan and worked for a couple of days. However it was not so clean and the toilet was loose. The first impression was not so great, but after some days the overall impression was okey. The manager was friendly and helpful and he could speak English. They have a nice rooftop where you can make your own food.",Date of stay: December 2016
Ricardo N,Brilliant hostel,"Probably one of the best hostels I have stayed in in a while. Friendly staff. Great social area and good location. Wifi is good as well. Just what you need from a hostel. Very close to beach and supermarket. Going back, can't wait. And have to give a shoutout to Michael.",Date of stay: November 2016

Nadia D,Great hostel,"We really enjoyed our stay at the hostel. Michael was so lovely and really looked after us while we were there. The private room we had was great and the rooftop chillout space is tops (with kitchen, couches and hammocks)!",Date of stay: October 2016
Alan C,Decent 3 night stay on first arrival into Sri Lanka.,"Chose to stay here rather than in centre of Colombo, turned out good call for me. Room was very basic but clean, shower functional, fan worked but it was hot, hot, hot! I live in central Thailand so not a stranger to heat but I found it sticky at night ( visited March 2016). You can zip along to the local train station and jump on a train to the heart of Colombo, tickets very very cheap and you are in the heart of Colombo in 20-30 mins, perfect. Hostel is situated max 10 mins walk to beach, beach has restaurants / bars etc. I had a few superb meals along the stretch of beach nearest the hostel. Bit of a walk to nearest convenience store, I couldn't find any handy, handy. Beach is clean as beaches go, nothing special for me but fine.  Hostel has a great common area on the roof",Date of stay: March 2016
Noel C,CBHome away from Home,"Gentleness ..... the first thing that comes to mind!  Despite the total Roughness of the Indian Ocean it is the kindness of Michael and his great staff and team that sooths. That fantastic RoofGarden ....Wow! Does anyone wants go  Dance upon the Roof!!! Even the cat does its share of making you feel at home....coming to your dorm door to say Hi and Bye. Clean, safe and most helpfull with every and any matter. 9 out  of 10! Must go back and see if i did not forget anything for a 10! :-) CBH matches Sri Lanka like no other. Yes....also the timely answering of emails, always constructive and friendly. Yess, definately 10 out of 10 No need to return.....but I will!",Date of stay: September 2016
cdroux,Spacious and relaxing!,"What a lovely way to end our holiday! Spacious and clean rooms with basic white bedding & big en- suite bathrooms. Keep in mind that this is a hostel - so no guesthouse benefits like bottled water or extra bedding. Very well priced - the host organized our transport to the airport the next day and allowed us to enjoy the day to the fullest and keep our bags safely in his foyer until departure. Amazing rooftop area for relaxing & for sunset drinks! Had a great stay and can highly recommend. Restaurants, the beach and other hotels just around the corner! Great for couples & groups of friends!",Date of stay: September 2016
KyleMcGee,"Nice guest house.. Little pricey, but nice service and vibe","I came to this place after seeing some reviews online. The staff was always great and they have a nice lounge area upstairs. They let me keep some things there for 2 months while I traveled around. I was a little worried, but everything was safe and sound when I returned. Great folks!",Date of stay: September 2016
Matthew B,Amazing place!,"Stayed in Colombo for 8 weeks whilst doing a placement and stayed in this hostel the entire time we were there!  Location: Located in Mount Lavina just south of the city centre. It's right on the beach which has numerous bars and restaurants. It has good links to other cities as near to the train station and the main road for buses.  Facilities: The only place we stayed in Sri Lanka with a kitchen which is good for when you want some home cooked Western food. An amazing, colourful rooftop terrace for chilling on. Stayed in a private room which was nice for the price!  Atmosphere: It was not uncommon for the hostel to be full as it was a place people came to at the start of their trip and when they came back around so it was good to pick up some tips for your travels along with",Date of stay: June 2016
James R,Out of the city,"Overall a great place to stay. Micheal the manager was extremely helpful, location isn't very central but still right on the beach and with lots of food places around and easy train or bus into town. Would definitely stay again.",Date of stay: August 2016
ankitbhat92,Not too bad,"The hostel is located in Mt. Lavinia which is quite far to the south of Colombo and the airport is to the north of Colombo. Hence it takes a long time to travel to and from the airport. Place was in need of some changes. The bathrooms were very small and not very well lit. Wifi only works on the rooftop. But, it is just of the beach of Mt Lavinia which is great. Besides, for that price point it is not fair to complain a lot.",Date of stay: February 2016
matthewgaskin,Great intro to Sri Lanka,"Stayed for the first 3 nights in Sri Lanka, Michael was very helpful and welcoming. The rooms are basic but all you need for exploring Mt Lavinia and Colombo. NB: though the hostel is not in Colombo you can catch a 20 min train to Colombo Fort along the coast for pennies. Roof garden is lovely, lots of options for food in surrounding area and literally 2 minutes from the beach.",Date of stay: July 2016
Ross C,"not great, but not bad for the price","not quite as pretty as the pictures, but functional! very helpful in changing room when we found bugs in our bed. fan is good at making a breeze in the room, but not quite AC.  close to the beach and plenty of tuktuks around. no hot water, but didn't need it in the heat!! has free wifi, which was alright, but cut out regularly.",Date of stay: July 2016

tomryan2431,very helpful staff,Great place to stay first time sri lanka as the staff are very friendly and helpful. No problem telling you the best way to get around. Also has a nice roof top bar to chill and meet fellow travellers.,Date of stay: June 2016
euroangelo,Convenient stop on the Southern edge of Colombo,The hostel is ok for a night or so. The bed could be more comfortable as it has no sheets you can put over you and the mosquito net tends to fall on you a bit towards the edged of the bed. Wifi is also hit or miss. The location is very convenient to Mt Lavina beach and there are plenty of restaurants just a short walk away.,Date of stay: June 2016
Chasams C,,,
Mel R,Good for a night or two,"Hostels appear to be few and far between in Sri Lanka so this is a good find in a nice location. Michael who runs the place is very kind and helpful. The dorm room we stayed in, while spacious, was incredibly hot. They need to invest in air conditioners. The kitchen is very basic, okay for making breakfast or a salad but not much else. Bathroom was okay although we had issues with shower constantly dripping. Rooftop area is really nice and the location is ideal. Not too far from the airport so a good spot to spend your first night or two after you arrive.",Date of stay: May 2016
Noelle P,Fab find,"A great price and location. The beach is just a few minutes walk away and the roof terrace is a perfect place to chill out during the heat of the day. The hosts helped us with everything we needed, up to and including an airport transfer.",Date of stay: April 2016

Powee1,A good first stop!,We stayed at this hostel straight from the airport and for two first time travellers it was perfect. Michael (host) was very helpful in giving us directions and tips about travelling Sri Lanka. The upstairs communal area was chilled and had good wifi and we met other travellers there. Beach and restaurants very close and lots of other things to do round Colombo. Great breakfast place just next door and easy to get tuk tuks everywhere. Only issue is that the heat of the room but this made the cold shower very refreshing.,Date of stay: March 2016
kassimati,A good place to explore Colombo and continue your journey onwards,"Stayed 3 nights, 2 in the dorm and one in the private room. Place was clean and the owner very friendly. It is a bit expensive for Sri Lankan standards but not for Colombo. For a similar level place in the center you have to pay at least double. To get to the city you can either take a tuktuk or the local bus (dirty cheap) or take the train. The train ride itself is a thing to experience in Sri Lanka plus the tracks run beside the ocean. Plus, with the train there is no traffic. Colombo has unbelievable traffic so avoid the rush hours as it might take you 10 minutes to get 100 meters. And this is a daily thing. The hostel is a long way from the airport so take that into consideration. If you are heading south, the Mt Lavinia trainstop is abt 2km away, reachable by tuktuk so the",Date of stay: February 2016
Lydia B,"Not clean, expensive",- Room was not clean (dirty and old sheets and towels)  - it was very hot during the nighttime (fand did not help out) + good location in Mount Lavinia: 300m walk to the beach + Rooftop terrace + Friendly and helpful staff,Date of stay: March 2016
Namasteista,,,
voodoopol,Not the best offer in the town....,"THE BAD: We booked here and I may say I don´t know exaclty why.. I guess just because budget. The thing is the place is not specially nice, not a beautiful location, surroundings or anything. Neither the rooms are nice. No AC rooms so.. mega hot inside. The manager try to be helpful but somehow he is not the most funny and smiling guy. They talk about their terrace as if were an amazing place, well is not, nothing to see around. I guess just by providing a little fridge with drinks you could improve the ""terrace experience"". No, they don´t sell beer.   THE GOOD: Just 2 min walking to the beach where you can find interesting places to have food, drinks..",Date of stay: February 2016
Shauns277,"Good hostel, not quite Colombo.","Despite the name this hostel is about 30mins away from central Colombo. It is a very nice area however it lacks culture and local businesses. I found it to be too tourist orientated (Mt Lavinia, not the hostel)  When I stayed at Colombo Beach the wifi wasn't working but the owners were trying to find a better solution. The rooftop area is a fantastic place to relax at the end of the day and meet fellow travellers... It had a very social vibe. It was also nice to be so close to the beach.",Date of stay: February 2016
Gehan W,Great place to meet fellow travelers.,"The staff was very friendly and helpful, with tips on how to get to my next destination, around town and arranging a cheap taxi to the airport.  The roof top was a great place for meeting other guests.",Date of stay: January 2016
Louisa Rose S,Not As Advertised,"We stayed here for 2 nights after arriving in Sri Lanka, and while we've stayed in much worse places this hostel really disappointed us, mainly due to the attidude of the manager Michael - unhelpful and arrogant. But for the price it's ok if you just need a bed for a night or 2.  Pros - clean-ish, big bed and nice lighting (in double room),   Cons - much further from the airport than described, roof terrace a bit shabby, 'free' drinking water not available, poor advice given, had to ask for bed sheets, lots of 'rules' to stick to - including an 11.30pm curfew which seemed totally inappropriate for a 'city' hostel.",Date of stay: January 2016
Julie D,Nice Hostel in Colombo,"Nice hostel in Colombo, very good welcome from the staff and Nice advices from the team.

Sannia A,Nice Hostel!,Great location and a nice hostel. Best thing about the hostel is its helpful staff specially Micheal who went out of his way to help me when I was not happy with my room. I feel rooms and toilets could be more cleaner but it all depends on the people staying in hostel otherwise the hostel is trying its best to keep it clean. Great rooftop and kitchen BTW!!!,Date of stay: July 2015
Amesx,"Clean hostel dorm, 3mins from the beach","Stayed here for 1 night upon arrival after reading all the rave reviews. The spacious dorm rooms and beds are clean. Common bathroom and toilets are also clean. Only have one problem to highlight which is that the 8-bedded dorm only has 1 ceiling fan and one tiny opening of a window. Air circulation is really bad, and it gets too hot and stuffy at night and you're literally soaking in sweat trying to get some shut eye. The side windows are sealed shut, it'll be better if there were more windows. It is otherwise a nice place with a roof top kitchenette and common area.",Date of stay: December 2015

Jordan T,Good clean hostel,"We stayed for one night when we arrived in Colombo. The transfer we organised through the hostel was waiting fantastic and was a nice and simple way to make your way to the hostel as it is a little out of the city. The hostel was simple, but clean and comfortable. It was great to be a little out of the hustle of the city and be nice and close to the coast.",Date of stay: September 2015
Lisa C,Great Hostel,"We stayed for one night here on our arrival in Colombo. Friendly and helpful staff, nice double room with ensuite and great roof terrace area to chill out and meet other guests. Very handy for the Mount Lavinia train station if you are planning on catching the train to Galle or elsewhere. There is also a really nice place for breakfast just next to the hostel. We tried to stay here on our way home but unfortunately there were no rooms available. The owner was very helpful and arranged for a taxi to take us to the airport at a very good rate. Would recommend as a nice place to stay for a few days in Colombo.",Date of stay: September 2015
Amy B,"Great hostel, great staff!","I stayed at Colombo beach hostel a couple times while I travelled through Sri Lanka. Great place to stay for solo travelers. It's in a great location near the beach, very social environment, great communal areas and tidy kitchen facilities!

Easily one of the best hostels I've stayed in!",Date of stay: July 2015
LouiseMcC89,Ideal Location to explore the coast,"Stayed here for 3 nights in September and couldn't fault the place. Very clean, comfortable and in a good location to explore the coastline. Michael is very friendly and knowledgeable. Go next door for breakfast to the Food Corner as the food is fantastic and so is the service. Highly recommend staying here.",Date of stay: September 2015
Theodora V,"Great location, great people","We spent our first night in SL here and it was a great start. The rooms are clean and they have a great roof terrace where you can hang out with other people from the hostel - it's really nicely decorated and you can make tea for yourself, or cocktails haha. It's also really close to the beach and a pub and Mt. Lavinia is a really nice location - close enough to the city but quiet and with much nicer people. Also, the owner, Dinesh, came and spoke to us and answered all of our questions , he even helped us put together an itinerary that turned out perfect and generally had great (and very honest) advice about everything. Michael (front desk) was also extremely nice and helpful. We left part of our bags with him so we can travel around with just backpacks and he took care of them",Date of stay: September 2015
Ben W,Good value and friendly staff,Nice hostel to start and end your trip to Sri Lanka. The manager Michael is very friendly and will help you as much as he can. Stayed here for 6 nights in total and would recommend it. The location is nice as it is away from the busy districts of Colombo. The roof patio is a good spot to hang out and the communal  kitchenette is handy for cooking up some basic meals.,Date of stay: September 2015
Pi-Anna-3,Not as expected....,"First off anyone staying here be aware it's a good 40 minute taxi drive from colombo airport!   When I arrived they didn't have my booking, possibly there fault or that of hostelworld but they said it wasn't a problem.  The staff here are lovely, willing to help you with anything and answer any and all questions you may have.   There are 6 beds in the female dorm not 4 as stated. There is a sign up as obviously they have had some complaints. They say it's to allow for walk-ins but everyone that was there during my stay had booked.   This meant the on-suite bathroom was shared between 6 of us, meaning your queuing every morning and night. There is no hot water here so don't expect anything other than a cold shower!!   As a suggestion to the hostel -  put up a shower screen up as",Date of stay: September 2015
ggbellz,Awesome,"Amazing, stayed 4 nights. Very clean, perfect location, comfortable beds, staff super friendly and nice and knowledgeable. Manager willing to help in any way he can, and can help you figure out the best low budget fun things to do ! Wifi was good, little hole in the wall restaraunt next door was the cutest and best place to get breakfast. Close to the sea turtle conservation project which is very interesting, highly recommend supporting this project as they are in need for renovations but doing very sincere and genuine work. Hostel has good crowds and amazing rooftop hangout, sunsets were unbelievable. Definitely recommend !!",Date of stay: September 2015

ldown45,Good value,Staff were really kind and friendly and although basic rooms did the job well. Only spent a night here but was still treated very well. In a really good location near the beach which is just beautiful and very good for food too.

mc232463,Great Roof Top Terrace - Okay Hostel,"We arrived at Colombo Beach Hostel very tired from our long flight to Sri Lanka, we were somehow disappointed at the fact we had booked a private room months in advance and to then be told upon arrival that they had no private rooms available... Since it was my birthday the following day and we were exhausted this wasn't the best start to our holiday. Fortunately they did put us in a 4-man dorm for the first bight which we had to ourselves, and we got a discount off the first night since it was not what we booked - though we only received this upon enquiring.  Both rooms were clean but very bare. The location of the hostel is great as it is out of Colombo in a quiet location and less than a 5 minute walk to the beach with lots of bars and restaurants.  The roof top terrace is",Date of stay: July 2015
daniel_traveller81,Super hostel,"I arrived at Colombo beach hostel directly after arriving in SriLanka. Quite jet lacked I checked in and got a marvelous clean room there. For the first two days I had a double room alone, later I went for one night in a four bed dorm, which was also fine. Michael, the manager of the hostel, was always very helpful and pointed me to the nice places nearby.  Worth noting is (of course) the roof top, where you easily meet new people.  Also the Food Corner next door is perfect for multiple visits, since you can get both there: marvelous SriLankan breakfast and delicious curry for lunch.  In total a great stay!",Date of stay: August 2015
Sanjay N,Nice start to a trip to Sri Lanka,"The room was nice and clean, the staff spoke very good English and were on hand to help at any time. The wifi was good and the roof terrace was lovely too. Very close to a place called food corner (10m) which served cheap, authentic food. Also very close to the beach which has places to drink and eat.   Only downside would be that the rooms opened into the courtyard and we therefore got bitten quite a lot. Overall a lovely place to stay however we didn't like Colombo that much and moved on reasonably quickly.",Date of stay: July 2015
Beau-Daniel R,Good Hostel in a nice area with a decent common area,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here in the private room. Michael is a lovely man who gives very good advise. The room was spacious and clean. No hot water in the shower may be of interest to some. The upstairs area is an absolute winner and a great place to unwind and chat with others. The restaurant next door serves great food, too. It's in a nice quiet area a stroll away from the beach - highly recommend.”",Date of stay: June 2015
Kanika,"Brilliant hostel, highly recommend!","I stayed here for 30 nights in June- July whilst doing a medical elective at Colombo south teaching hospital. I really really enjoyed my stay- the room was clean and the staff are really helpful. Michael the manager, who is happy to help you with info on anything to do in the area and the best ways of travelling round.  The location is a little out of Colombo but it's easy enough to get into the centre, you just have to take a bus or the train and it's quite nice to be so close to the sea and also very near the city.  The rooftop terrace is a massive selling point, a really cool place to relax and it's where everyone hangs out so its good for meeting people and stuff.  The food corner next door is really convenient, tasty and perfect for breakfast,and the guys that run it are so",Date of stay: June 2015

MollyWolfe,"Excellent hostel in prime location, lovely staff and brilliant rooftop!","I stayed at Colombo Beach Hostel on 3 separate occaisons on my trip to Sri Lanka. The first, when I arrived in Sri Lanka, the second when I returned to Colombo to extend my visa, and the third on my way out.  The location is good, as it's 5 mins from the beach and only 40 mins from the Airport (ish) and Mount Lavinia is a nice little area to explore, or you can walk 2mins up the road to Galle Rd for supermarkets, shops etc.  I stayed in a dorm room (4 beds) for around Rs1200 per night. The rooms are basic but comfortable with a big en suite bathroom, fans, linen provided etc.   There is also free coffee upstairs on the roof, and a kitchen so you can make your own meals which saves money as the nearby beachside restaurants are expensive!  It's nice to arrive in a country and be",Date of stay: April 2015
NomadsVenture,Great place to meet people close to the beach! Awesome rooms,"I loved this place!! I am always looking for spots close to the beach and this one is just blocks away, less than 5 minutes walk. The rooms are awesome, very industrial looking but still cozy and everything either new or great conditions. What I loved the most was the rooftop, the common area upstairs. With floor cushions and tons of seating areas, benches, dining tables and a KITCHEN!! big pluuuus you will meet people for sure. I am traveling alone so it's important for me to have a cool meeting area and this was just perfect! Equipped with speakers to hook up your phone, fans, coffee and tea available for you free of charge, just a great place to stay wether you are traveling solo or not.

chongzi L,very bad value for money!!!,"our last night in sri lanka and this place was a big bummer! bad value for money! Very basic room. For 30 USD, u get nothing. no hot water, no A/C, no breakfast, not even a mosquito net!! We had to close the window in order to avoid being ate alive by mosquitos, which was uncomfortable at all because it was so damn hot!! The fan helped a little yet it made loud noises. i barely slept.  They do have a pretty rooftop area for chilling but it is just a nice adds-on not enough to make up the uncomfortable room.",Date of stay: May 2015
JSchwalger,Great stay,"We stayed 2 nights at Colombo Beach Hostel, one at the start of our trip to Sri Lanka and one at the end. It was a comfy if basic hostel, but ample for our needs.

Cute kitten as well, Jerry, who had been adopted by Michael after his mother abandoned him :)",Date of stay: April 2015
JEH_1985,"Good service, good prices","We weren't huge fans of Mount Lavinia as a whole - we much preferred the beaches to the south (Mirissa and Tangalle) and even Negombo if you're heading north - but this was a good, well-run place to stay. The owner Michael was very helpful and arranged a day at the rather fancy Mount Lavinia Hotel for us which meant we could use their pool and private beach for free all day if we bought lunch there. The rooms are unflashy, reasonably priced and do the job. Food tip: Food Corner next door serves a delicious breakfast and the owner is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet.",Date of stay: March 2015
Louise A,Amazing place,"came across this place on hostel bookers for our first night in Sri Lanka. Cheap and modern hostel. Rooms are basic and well kept. There was hot water as far as I can remember. Very close to mount Lavinia beach. Which was quiet and so relaxing after a full night of travelling. The rooftop was great and had a great view, with comfortable seats, free tea and coffee and a gas stove so you can cook.  Michael is great, so friendly and welcoming and always great to have a chat with. Fully recommended.",Date of stay: March 2015
JFTrumm,Spartan Hostel; Wonderful Manager,"The Colombo Beach Hostel is about three residential blocks away from a nice beach on the Laccadive Sea. It’s a fairly Spartan hostel, without much in the way of decoration, design, or amenities. But what it lacks in that department is more than compensated for by its owner/manager, Michael, whose low-key helpfulness and knowledge of the area made the stay worthwhile for me.  I stayed in a dorm-style co-ed room on the second floor. There was an ensuite bathroom attached to the room, but it was little more than a concrete room with a sink, toilet and shower nozzle. The light was dim and the concrete walls and floor made it seem dirtier than it probably actually was. The showers ran cold to barely tepid. The room itself was a little more cheerful, but since there were no window",Date of stay: February 2015

Nice common space with great wifi and a nice cat that will jump onto your lap if you sit in the big red chair. Don't miss out the ""cafe"" next door (Food corner). 290 rs and you'll get a fruit plate with banana and papaya, tea or coffee, 4 pol roti and a egg. And it taste amazing. And the owner are the best! Always smiles, work alone and runs to the kitchen after taking an order.",Date of stay: February 2015
John A,"Nice place, next-door cafe great","Stayed here a few days at start and end of holiday. Friendly, helpful manager and staff. Clean, basic rooms. Good value for money. Cafe next door is excellent - great value for money, good food, generous portions, and the nicest service I think I've ever come across. The owner/manager is a practising Buddhist who knows a thing or two about meditation and brings that into the way he treats his customers. Highly recommend the Sri Lankan breakfast - sets you up for the day.",Date of stay: May 2014
Arjen B,"No frills, fantastic coffee!","Don't let the somewhat Spartan rooms dissuade you, because this is a great place when you want to avoid the choking traffic of Colombo.  Our room was pretty spacious, and the bed was quite comfortable, despite it not having any top sheets. Our shower was cold, but that's something we could live with.  The beach is only a hop over the train tracks away, and the Sri Lankan coffee, supplied in the main lobby, is great as well.  In short, book this place!  In addition, please please please make sure to visit the tiny Food Corner restaurant next to the hotel, where we had amazing breakfast and dinner for prices way lower than any of the beach restaurants. The owner is so friendly you want to cuddle him. You won't be disappointed!",Date of stay: January 2015

CindyandSam_M,"Simple, clean, and quiet!",We booked this guesthouse for the first couple of night into our Sri Lanka trip as decent accommodation in Colombo seemed a bit expensive and we figured that it would be good to stay away from the hustle and bustle. Best decision we could have made! The rooms are simple but really clean. The owner of the guesthouse is SUPER helpful and gave us heaps of tips for our Sri Lanka trip. We also booked a day tour of Colombo through him as we thought the pricing was very reasonable and probably the best way to see the main sites in such chaotic city (which are spread out across the city).   After a long day of site-seeing we arrived back at the guest-house and the owner organized (don’t ask us how) for us to go the nearby 5 star hotel and only spend a total no more than $10 each on food,Date of stay: October 2014

There's so much things to see at the beach, the locals seems to gather during afternoon to play sports and family gatherings. Nice view of the sunset as well!

The main area is a great place to met other travelers as is the roof top where you can also chill out with a few beers and watch the sunset. There is a little cafe right next door, the owner here is also lovely and he cooks amazing food.  Great place to stay, and close to everything! :)",Date of stay: October 2014
Emily S,Nice hostel,"This hostel was very clean and well located. We arranged pick up from the airport which was an additional $19.   Only complaint was that the front desk never seemed to have change, even if we went multiple times in a day and had paid them with what would have been the correct change for later transactions. They said they'd give it back but never did. Ultimately its just a few dollars but odd and worth noting. May be best to try and always have the exact change.",Date of stay: September 2014
Travellingaround07,Very good hostel for backpackers,"The place is nice located, next to the beach. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They helped me organize my trip in Sri Lanka.

There is also a super friendly restaurant just in front of the hostel. So to sum up, if you're looking for a nice and cheap stay, I highly recommend this hostel !",Date of stay: August 2014

He knows a lot about his country and will give you great tips to organize your trip. Best value in Mount Lavinia, just 2 min walk from the beach and from the beach restaurant La Voile Blanche which is the best place in Colombo to enjoy the sunset. 10 min walk from main ATMs and supermarkets, 2 minutes from Mount Lavinia train station and 30 min in tuk-tuk from Colombo Railway Station (cost about 800LRK)",Date of stay: September 2014

The room is minimal, with cement floor and a couple of cement tables. Bathroom is in the same style, quite clean as the rest of the room. For a budget hostel, this style was quite good. The hostel is close to the beach but there's no beach view or direct access. Taxi drivers may have a tough time locating it so keep the address with you. Our room window had a broken glass and even if you managed to close it properly (using the make-shift hasps) rain could still come in.

davisrobyn,Lovely stay by the beach,"I enjoyed my stay at Colombo Beach Hostel, made especially great by Raja who was always there to help with anything we needed and was lovely to chat to. The rooms are clean and newly done but I would say that the one aspect which tainted my stay was the manager, Angelo. Angelo was rude, grumpy and spoke to other employees in a foul manner as well as making them to do some ridiculous, and in my eyes demeaning, tasks. For example, rub cream onto his chest for him as well as call for someone to fetch things for him that were in arms reach. This caused quite a lot of discomfort among my group as well as another group we spoke to at the same hostel.",Date of stay: July 2014
