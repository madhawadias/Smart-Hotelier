The in room safe was broken. Bathroom amenities are very good with instant and good pressure hot water in the shower. The room also had a bath. The bar has a good selection of drinks. I noticed that the 4 staff seemed to be more interested in leaning on the bar and chatting to each other rather than looking out for guests’ needs. The breakfast buffet included has a good variety of local and other foods although the buffet is crowded space. Pork products are not served. The omelette made in order was excellent.

Also our complain for the delayed service was met with complete indifference while the guests around us who were paying for a la carte were constantly being given  preference.

Our breakfast was included in the room rate and was fantastic with plenty of variety, both western and Asian and there was a chef cooking fresh eggs, waffles and crepes. The majority of the staff were very friendly and helpful. There is a shopping centre about a 10 minute walk away, with a very good food court and a supermarket.

The hotels best feature is the pool, a great size and we also spotted a few monitor lizards which was great! The beers and drinks were about average price for this kind of location. Room size was good, however the rooms themselves were a bit tired and could do with an upgrade.  Breakfast was actually quite good, although the dining room itself was fairly packed in and a bit on top of each other.

Now they have increased the price (Rs.2,500/- for two) and give a cheap spread of food which is not even edible. I come down from Canada twice a year or so and have been to Ramada a few times and they provided a set menu and vegetarian. Me and my family enjoyed this food for many years and cannot believe that they have come down to this level. The food tasted horrible, they were tiny nothings (for example, cucumber wrapped in rice and this is no sushi, tiny pieces of bread topped with eggplant seeds which has no flavour whatsoever, and sweets which is basically coconut cake and some other stuff wrapped in sugar to name a few).

On the first night we were given a room at the front of the hotel where the windows were not sealed properly so we could hear traffic all night long. On check out I requested a room at the back of the hotel for the second night we were staying in the ramada colombo. On checkin for the second night we were given another room at the front of the hotel so I asked again for one at the back of the hotel, this was arranged but on going to our room we quickly realised our room was adjacent to the elevator shaft, so again plenty of background noise.

For every name of the beer we asked, the answer was no. This situation was so ridiculous that we could not even have wine from the menu. I’ve never encountered anything like this before in all the hotels I’ve previously stayed in, this was just beyond surprising. No one seemed to care or provide any other alternatives.

It was quite a mess. I thought maybe it's because I requested early checkin so room was not prepared. But it happened on all 4 days. The other major problem I had was dealing with the staff, they were so slow and lacked willingness to do anything. Room service calls were answered after 10-15 Rings on an average, the receptionist was not welcoming, he did not even arrange for a local taxi when asked for.

Carpet needs to be replaced! The lobby is grand, unfortunately the rest of hotel not at the same standard. The oasis bar is average.

My room lock wasn't working (couldn't open with the access card) and was conveyed at check in itself.....but no one bothered to address the issue till my check out 2 days later...and everytime I moved out for breakfast or dinner or meetings I was locked out and had to call for assistance !! and the reception guys expect you to come down all the way multiple floors to get the duplicate keys !!

Cashier attempted to overcharge us on every room , yes it was only £5 per room but it was the principle. No rooms were available so they were doing their best to stall us (this was around 4pm - check in was 2) cashier proceeded to argue with us a lot, eventually manager arrived but clearly cashier wasn't going to let it go and carried on arguing. Rooms we were given were wrong they were twins, so yet again had to speak to the manager who eventually sorted it. My room tv didn't work, maintence man appeared and fixed it.

The buffet in itself wasn't extensive considering Sri Lankan hotels are known for large varieties. However, the masked difference in this buffet was the quality of the food. Each dish was cooked to perfection with plenty of flavor.   The choice on the menu too was impressive, a fusion of European cuisine made this a perfect choice for the occasion.   The only negative was the waffles...the chef needs to work on getting a perfectly crispy product...which was unfortunately not the case.

It seems that the Ramada is a prime wedding location and this explains the boisterous, boozed-up and quarrelsome fellow guests who will ruin your night rest (which no amount of complaining to the night staff will avail).
