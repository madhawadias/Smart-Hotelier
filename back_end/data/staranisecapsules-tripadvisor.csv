We didn’t get the one in the menu and it was still 8:15 am (they serve from 7 to 9 am). So they offered us a sandwich with sardine, mayonnaise and onions plus tomato.

So because of this naturally I had the habit of sleeping slightly later than usual. When I went to have breakfast at 9:11 I went to sit down and with put greeting or even standing and coming too my table the manager shouted across the room to me breakfast is over. Then when I told him it 11 minutes past 9 he got up and straight away changed his posture and attitude to be ready to be aggressive. If you can not even compromise 11 minutes on a breakfast which someone paid for you should not be a person in hospitality. And this is the manager of the establishment.

Reason being, while i was researching place to stay in Colombo, the way this property describes itself is confusing. They say ""privates"" on a booking.com (or some other site i visited). But the pictures looked like bunkbeds. So i visited them to get clarity and it was indeed bunk bed. Maybe its just me but putting a curtain on bunk bed does not make it a private. Almost all the places i have stayed in past only advertise ""private"" when they are selling you a room and not just a bed in dorm.

I'm afraid though, that the main thing we came away with was a sense that we had not stayed in a capsule hotel, but rather in an expensive hostel dorm with roller blinds over the beds. These blinds offer a degree of visual privacy, but don't mask any sounds. We therefore heard every syllable of our delightful German dorm mates post pub conversation when they returned home. Danke schön.  There is also no proper storage space (in a normal hostel there is at least usually this). For the price I would expect some.

Definitely recommend staying here.,JamieSchneider,Fantastic start to my adventure,"I rarely sleep in dorm rooms because I find them too loud, gross or non-private. This is the complete opposite. It's so clean, the linens are fantastic and I swear I had the best sleep in weeks here. Everyone working here was unbelievably friendly and definitely made me leave for the rest of my Sri Lankan adventure with a positive attitude.  The only negatives were the water being shut off in the morning(not their fault) but the manager gave us all free water so not a problem!  Despite being super safe (you need to be buzzed in and there is always someone at the front desk) you do need to leave your shoes downstairs, outside near the front door (in order to keep the floors clean). I was a bit hesitant, but nothing went missing and there's usually a solider waking around outside",Ben L,Great fun,Need a cheap place to stay in central Colombo? This is the place. No frills but superbly managed and spotlessly clean. A great experience. The dormitory is air conditioned and very quiet for a good night's sleep. There are lockers to kerp your valuables in. Vincent the manager loves his job and tries to make your stay as comfortable as possible.,Marie B,"Very good ""hostel"" !!",My stay at Star anise was great ! The localisation is perfect : in the center. The hostel is very nice and clean. The staff is kind and helpful. They serve a simple breakfast. Also very secured ! I'd recommend staying there!,hani754,Great capsules smack in the city,"Amazing place! All that i needed; comfy large bed, clean place overall, cool aircond, blinds that provided privacy, warm showers.   One thing that could be improved: separate male n female toilets please in the future.",AceBayron,Awesome stay!,Great staff and awesome place to stay in Colombo. The location is near everywhere and espescially the train station if you plan to diacover the mainlands of Sri Lanka. Another things is the comfort the capsules offer its very relaxing and privacy is not ang issue.,Jantien v,Very clean new place,"It's a clean place with a nice bed, friendly staff and quit (so you will have a good night rest). The temperature is good (not too warm or cold), the shower is good as well. The breakfast was simple, some fruit would be nice but it was tasty though.",aklkien,Ideal place for one night transit in Colombo for single traveller.,"This place is very central and clean. Staff are friendly. It's ideal for single traveler, or 2 people. And good value! And breakfast is included! :) People around this place were very friendly I didn't have any safety concern at all. :)",tan-jonathan,An excellent budget accommodation,Very clean and comfortable with good Wi-Fi.  Near the old dutch hospital and fort.  Shared toilets were also clean and staff would dry the toilets every now and then.   Breakfast was also decent for the price paid.   No shoes within the premise.,Date of stay: May 2017mirandapalar,Cozy stay,"It was the first time I spent a night in Colombo, alone, and I felt lucky to stay in this concise, strategic, comfortable, clean, and friendly accommodation. Highly recommended place to stay, especially for foreign backpacker travellers",giup655,Clean and nice rooms,"The rooms are very clean and nice. You have the feeling of your own room even if it a 10 bedroom and the beds are very comfortable. The hostel is located in a nice area and very close to the trainstation Colombo Fort. The stuff is very helpful and friendly, they keep also the rooms safe by a camera.",expat_in_hongkong,"Clean, comfortable, well-airconditioned, safe,","I was a bit hesitant to stay in a capsule hotel because it just sounded weird.  But, after staying there for a night, I can surely recommend the experience.  For those of use used to bunking in communal rooms in a hostel, this is NOTHING like that.  You actually get total privacy with a nice curtain that closes your bed off to the rest of the room, safe storage for your bags, and its super clean!   The only thing that I struggled with a bit was that the toilet and shower area was one room for both men and women.  Of course there are doors on the shower and toilet stalls, but it's just not something I am particularly used to.  I got over it pretty easily.",Date of stay: April 2017Osias_Lim,"Great accommodation, great location, great staff","I had a great stay!

The price is amazing to the location and the capsules are very very comfortable and clean as well as extremely friendly and courteous staff!  Thanks to Stephen and his team, we had a great stay!  Will definitely return!",Date of stay: March 2017NZBarry,Wonderful,"I kind of left my booking for Colombo accommodation until quite late, because nothing really appealed. Then this place opened, and I snapped it up - its great! I had one of their capsules - it was very comfortable and I felt like I had plenty of space. When I got tired of an afternoon, I could crawl in there and read or nap - totally quiet the whole time I was there (three nights).  The bathrooms were spotless at all times: when someone used one, the staff would be straight in to make sure everything was clean, and squeegee the floor if someone had had a shower. With the number of guests, two bathrooms was a bit short, but they were putting in another.  The common area has a couple of sofas, some tables, TV and so on - never over-crowded. The wifi always worked very well, except",Date of stay: January 2017dianasB7194OY,,,dinal443,Very good,"Very good night of sleep, the bed was very comfy and big. The Hostel was very clean. Staff really Helpfull, but they dont prepare us the breakfast early like we have. Dont stay more than a Night in Colombo, dont have to many tô see.",AJM_reviews,"Modern, Cheap and very Comfortable!","Lovely, clean and modern capsule style hostel. I needed somewhere to put my head down for about 4 hours in Colombo as I landed in the middle of the night and was catching an early train the next morning. This was the perfect location for the train station which was also why I chose it.   The staff were lovely and friendly and helped settle me in at 4:00am and showed me where everything was. There was a complimentary bottle of water on my bed which was a great touch. Breakfast was also included and the boiled egg & tomato sandwich helped start me off for the day.   The bathroom & toilet facilities were good, very clean and quite modern.  The wifi was free and worked well.   Definitely worth checking out if on a budget and need somewhere to crash for 1 / 2 nights.",Date of stay: March 2017nelson m,"Central, clean and confortable","Simpathy of all personnal. Good AC and possibility of laundry service. Good internal ambiance, confort and clean of the space. Would like a little better breakfast. Simply to find and central situated",Wanja,Comfortable bed in central location,"Stayed two nights here. The bed was very comfortable and this was the only place in Sri Lanka I got a duvet. It is centrally located close to trainstation, Galle Face Green, several resturants, shops and bars in the old colonial dutch hospital. Surprisingly quiet. AC and wifi was good. Lockers right under the beds /capsules for valuables.",2nai2,Best accommodation in Colombo,"By far the cleanest accommodation I've found in Sri Lanka.

I strongly recommend this place, I would definitely go back.",Date of stay: February 2017123_Tia,Nice and clean place,"We already booked one night in a double capsule before we started our vacation. We informed the staff that we will arrive late and it was no problem that we checked in at 10:30pm.   Everything is clean and as you would expect it. The breakfast is a bit small - tea or coffee and a sandwich. You can buy cold softdrinks.  Maybe a bit pricey if you just want to have a short sleepover if you are arriving late as we did, but besides that everything was fine!",Date of stay: February 2017undermyway,,,Mark Jos P,2 nights in Colombo,"The hotel is new and clean. The location is really good. In the old city part near Fort. The old Dutch Hospital is nearby with some amazing restaurants, varying from very cheap to expensive (from a Sri Lanka point of view) The staff was helpfull and fiendly and the breakfast was good.    Disadvantage is the washing room in the sleeping dorm. Hotel staff will do laundry at nights, this includes ironing and making at least some noise and use of lights. It kept us away for a good bit of 1 night.   The old town is very expensive hotelwise, compaired to other hotels, this hotel is cheap. Although, if you choose to sleep a few kilometers away, you will be able to find something much cheaper, but further away from everything.",Date of stay: January 2017Macoona,Clean and cozy for a dorm,"Very good place to stay for a night after arriving at Colombo and want to take the train or the bus the next morning. Both stations are very close to the hotel, in walking distance. The rooftop terrace could be more cozy, with nice light or sitting places.",Date of stay: February 2017Connector584107,Good & bad,"Double capsules decent size,new & clean. Annoying that the staff is passing by the capsules day & night as the laundry is just next to it. Very difficult to get some sleep as they are cleaning all day. Not bad located though.",Date of stay: February 2017Jessie E,Great Budget Stay in Colombo!,"This place just opened, and they are really focused on making sure guests have the best possible service during their stay. I've stayed twice now, two different times passing through Colombo. The first time, in December, I was with my boyfriend and a friend, and we had booked one double and one single premium capsule. Because the hotel wasn't fully booked that night, they actually put my friend in the double capsule area with us so we could all be in the same area! They were really helpful with information about trains and bus information, and scheduling a car for my friend to head to the airport.   After the good first experience, when my boyfriend and I came back through Colombo at the end of our Sri Lanka trip in January, we booked another night in a double capsule.

The hostel is extremely clean and well constructed and when the lay complete there terrace BBQ area this will be a fantastic place. We only stayed the one night at the end of our trip but our 4am flight meant we had to leave at 1am the following night. We didn't want to waste the money on another booking so we asked if we could leave our bags till 12:30 that night after we had checked out.

With less than 1km from Colombo Fort railway, it's an easy walk with backpacks. So you can even avoid the added expense of a Tuk-tuk ride if you want.  Our double bed capsule had the most comfortable mattress, 6 pillows, a cozy duvet and a great breakfast included.  Super fast WiFi, an abundance of WC's, security door, location, great staff, privacy.  I could go on and on about how good this place is.
