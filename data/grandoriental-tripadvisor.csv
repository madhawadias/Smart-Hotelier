LornaWatson,Pleasant stay,"I was a bit dubious about this hotel having read some of the reviews, but went ahead as was only one night and it was very reasonable, in fact cheap.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The room was clean and comfortable, the staff were all helpful and pleasant.  I had an enjoyable drink and very nice dinner with superb views in the rooftop bar and restaurant.  What more do you need for a stopover in a very convenient central location?  I would have no hesitation staying here again.",Date of stay: February 2020
cabeysiriwardhane,Theme Night - Valentine Gala Dinner,One of the best Theme night we have visited. One of the best senary of Colombo harbor.  The arrangement of the restaurant was excellent. The Buffet and the spread have been arranged in a beautiful manner.,Date of stay: February 2020
Speranzasf,Please lower your expectations - avoid 4th floor,"The BUILDING is iconic but the hotel is just a basic roof to stay in Colombo if you just need shelter for 1 night and you are on a limited budget.  PLEASE avoid 4th floor. This is a hotel with an old floor plan design so there is not back hallways meaning that housekeeping,  banquets and culinary trolleys and carts will be pushed all day and NIGHT through the guestrooms hallways on this floor. The reason is because the meeting rooms are on this floor and if there are functions there will be a parade of trolleys as long as the functions last including at night. When I stayed at GOH there was a police gathering reunion (evening function) in one of the meeting rooms and the event ended by midnight so the trolleys and carts were back and forth until 2am! I stayed in room 428.  Good",Date of stay: February 2020
Megan F,"Great stay, as expected","The hotel was in a great location. It was easy to walk everywhere. The room was fine. The hotel is a bit run down, but the old colonial charm makes up for it. We had a good stay. The breakfast was nice, but expensive. We were there on a holiday, and it was the only option, so it was even better! If you expect 5 star, this hotel will disappoint, but as a room and shower, it was great. We would stay again.",Date of stay: February 2020

LibbyDevon,An authentic Sri Lankan experience,"We stayed at the GOH from Saturday 25th Jan until Monday 27th and were charmed. This is an historical location, right where travellers docked and gained their first impressions of 'Ceylon'. Having flown in overnight we were greeted with courtesy and a welcome drink, and shown to a clean, quiet spacious room. Certainly the decor is a little tired, but it's got bunches of character. If you want to go to a swanky could be anywhere in the world establishment, and pay 4x as much go ahead. The staff at the GOH were charming and made our stay a pleasure. Would thoroughly recommend to those discerning enough to appreciate the old world style. Well done GOH !",Date of stay: January 2020

Madara Perera,NEEDS A MAJOR FACELIFT..,"Past glory...this place is really tired and old. I do not understand why the management still not doing anything or planing to go for an immediate renovation.. They need it badly.... Just damped and humid walls, and smells due to that I think.  Also they need to change from the furnishing to the staff visibility at earliest possible. I think being an old and heritage became super marketing trend but the look and feel of this hotel only rely on past glory. they can do more and do a facelift to keep their old colonial grand look and the same time city luxury with no fail on maintenance. We love this place as its most iconic here in the city, but in a situation like this unfortunately we can not recommend for anyone anymore  except the feeling of historic and amazing architecture",Date of stay: August 2019

Guruyb,Fantastic heritiage hotel,The location of the hotel cant be anything better. its located infront of the colombo port and next to the police head quarters. Its a very old hotel one of the landmarks during its day. it manages to retain the hertitage look and great value for money.  i have given 4 stars as the room is old and requires immediate renovation. but for the price you pay its more than worth it.  I would highly recommend this place,Date of stay: July 2019

Camila Ogawa | Japarioca ________,Old and smelly,"The hotel has more than hundred years history. Mustêve been an iconic place in the past, but nowadays itês only too outdated. Iêve stayed in hotels with long history before, this one has no charm on it. When we arrived a security guy checked our bags (I believe it started since the sad incident that happened this year), he opens our bags and check it using his hands. Itês not really effective and can be unpleasant. One of the things that I noticed since my arrival was the smell of the place. It smells old and humid, might not be a good choice for people with allergies or respiratory sensitivity. My room was also quite smelly and the smell quite stays in your clothes and hair. The room was outdated but ok, the bed was two twin bed together and can be uncomfortable for couples",Date of stay: August 2019

Coffee was decent, though unsurprisingly pricey",Date of stay: March 2019
OntarioTrekker,Grand old hotel that needs serious updating.,I just stayed one night prior to a cruise but would not recommend a longer stay since the harbour area is not attractive or perhaps safe.

martin v,old charm with very good service,"It was our hotel for the first and last nights of our trip. Located in the heart of Colombo Fort, the grand dame recalls a previous era which is its charm. In room 341, the hot water takes awhile but eventually gets there. The AC unit's condensation leaks in the corner of the room., be sure not to put anything underneath that must not get wet. The Saturday and Sunday buffets in the 4th floor restaurant were excellent with a wide variety to choose from.  There is a Spa facility, also on the 4th floor but didn't see any mention of it in the room. There is a small museum ( a small room) on the 4th floor but unfortunately it is locked. You can look through the glass doors to see some old artifacts.",Date of stay: March 2019
GermanFelix,Good for one night to be nearby train station,"We stayed our first night here, easy 15 min walk from the Fort train station where also the local bus from the airport finishes. We received a nice welcome juice. The hotel looks to have had a great past but no investments for a long time. There is a cheap local restaurant nearby recommended on tripadvisor and used by many locals: Fort Pillawoos (not the cleanest but okay if you are hungry). The hotel works well as an option for the early train to Kandy the next morning due to its proximity to the train station. The area around has also seen better days. Tuktuk drivers hang around the entrance in case you donêt fancy to walk.",Date of stay: March 2019
ShvRm_Traveller,Dated. Looks much better in photos,"This is an iconic hotel located adjacent to Colombo Port gate, housed inside a historic colonial building. The hotel looks great in photos in comparison to the actual condition. The hotel is located on street which is very busy during the day, but deserted at night. The building shares space with the surrounding building, most of which are build during colonial times. The area as well as the hotel building appears quiet impressive from the outside. From inside the building shows its age. The rooms, the passage ways, the lobby, etc are all spacious with high ceiling. It appears that, the timely maintenance of the building is being carried out however, the new repairs does not blend with the original interiors. Being an aged building, there is limit to which the modern amenities",Date of stay: May 2018
Gary the Pirate,Beautiful glimpse of the past,"I spent a week at the start and a day at the end of an epic visit to Sri Lanka. The GOH is big and correspondingly so are the rooms.

repatto,Wow,Spent a night there before catching train to Kandy. It was built in 1837 and is absolutely beautiful and kept true to its heritage.

Craig L,A Colonial Gem,"In my travels I make an effort to seek out these old Empire era hotels and this is the first time I had stayed at the GOH. Following the old patterns this was built adjacent to the old port and Customs House and it does not disappoint. In the heart of old Colombo it is a step back in time and one can almost feel the presence of the bygone era in the foyer.   The rooms are a spacious and are a bit dogeared, but that is part of the charm. I believe the GOH is government run, but the staff do a wonderful job and are attentive. Given its location the prices are relatively reasonable.  I am not a buffet type person, but admittedly they do a wonderful job for all 3 meals and usually you can get a table overlooking the port complex.   It can get a bit noisy in the hallways if you have",Date of stay: February 2019

As the other reviews tend to suggest - youêll either love it or hate it.  At the discounted rate we paid, it was a bargain to stay at somewhere so historic and iconic.

My Tropical Journal,Nice Hotel with an Old Look,"One of the oldest hotels in the heart of Colombo with an easy access to many prime locations. The property was a colonial bungalow built by a Dutch governor in 1837.  Being one of the modern hotel in former era, today it definitely need a facelifting.   Clean tidy rooms look dated  in comparison to other hotel rooms in the area. Furniture, interior and other amenities need an upgrade. Manageable for one or two nights but may not be enjoyable someone looking for a longer stay.   Tasty buffet had a nice spread. There is a small pastry hut to grab quick snacks. Staff is friendly and supportive.    Overall nice experience if rooms were up-to standards.",Date of stay: November 2018
134Martin,Friendly welcome,Popped in to see this grand old hotel which is bit like a time capsule from colonial days. Lots of dark wood panelling. Went up to restaurant to see views over the port.

Kerry,Grand old Dame.,"Mixed review for this hotel, certainly a piece of history in Colombo.  Hotel has a lift, the service from staff very good.  The foyer has a lot of atmosphere as do the corridors of this hotel if you talk a walk around and look.   My room had a glimpse of the port, not as noisey as I thought I would be.  My room was basic but comfortable. Being an old hotel it is difficult to ""upgrade"" to give modern amenities.    Could do with some 'bleach' in the bathroom to get rid of mould.  WIndows opened!  The restaurant was definitely worth eating in.  Food and service was excellent.  I don't smoke but went out on the balcony from the restaurant has stunning views.

Sure it's in a bit of a time warp, but it is obvious it was a grand hotel in it's time and still offers great value for money. It is not expensive. The view from the dining room is fantastic, even better on the outside balcony adjacent to the dining room. We were there during New Year's Eve celebrations, great timing, as the staff turned out a great night with fabulous decorations, great music, dancing and memorable food.

One of the oldest Hotels in Colombo I think. You have to check with them for food festivals and man O' man the food is off the charts with good selection. International buffet is not the best though. Reasonably priced and great staff. Speak to Anil. The friendly guy i always deal with on my reservations. I am a regular. Oh during festival dinners the music is magnificent.

First, most rooms are adjoining, meaning you'll be hearing your neighbor next door through the night. The beds are uncomfortable and rooms are outdated. When was the last time you've seen a CRT tv in a room with analog like reception. The worst is you won't get any sleep because of the noise.   Second, the location is in a seedy part of town.

It was simply amazing. 3. The view of the port from the restaurant is gorgeous. Try waking up early to see the sunrise from the restaurant window. 4. Rooms gave you an old-school authentic feel.  5. That mild music radios to wake you up in the morning reminds you of the old and classic hotels about which you just get to read nowadays. 6. The snack shop at the entrance of the hotel keeps delicious on the go snacks at very very cheap prices.  Cons- 1. The furniture and fittings are too old.

This is a very old hotel and the inside was obvious- worn down rooms with small black old school TVs. Itês very dated and the bathroom is clean, but looks untidy with the worn look. Staff friendly and the breakfast was pretty decent with a good variety- especially the omelette station. Cooked really well and tasted good. WiFi was the best out of the hotels I stayed at and the walls are paper thin!

It was the last hotel of the tour and was certainly the low light of the week by far.   Our group of 10 arrived at 5.30pm and we had a pre arranged booking through the Trip A Deal Tour. However, our group were kept waiting for over 40 minutes for our keys to be issued. None of the staff seemed to know what was going on, and most were frantically making telephone calls. And then my wife and I were told our room still was not ready and we would have to wait a little while longer.

The hotel is located in the heart of Colombo and  is a replica of colonial times. The historical atmosphere is felt as one enters this majestic building, although it is somewhat dilapidated. The entrance and lobby are  quiet and sleepy with few staff to be seen .   The ascent to the harbour room  at the top of the building is exciting as  one can use the ancient lift has been well preserved .  Inspite of the obvious lack of resources to upkeep this hotel, the management is doing a remarkable job arranging theme nights and lavish buffet dinners and lunches with live music.

Azurian,A bit disappointing.,"We really love staying in old colonial style hotels,and over the years have stayed in quite a few. Unfortunately the GRH isn't one of the best. It has its good points- all of the staff were good and the food we ate was particularly good- especially the evening buffet which was one of the best we ate in Sri Lanka- the view from the restaurant overlooking the harbour was impressive.. Our room was OK, the double bed was a bit small and the bathroom needed a lot of work. The room was incredibly noisy- there is constant noise from the docks, not helped by the windows having big gaps around them- luckily we had ear plugs with us.  The area around the hotel is pretty seedy,so luckily the food was great and we had no reason to go out. Tuk tuk from the Fort station is only RS200.",Date of stay: October 2017

We have visited this place long ago in 1980s for a wedding function. It is still the same and its reputation has grown with time. The restaurant is on the fourth floor and we booked a table for our small group. It is one of the best buffet dinners we had in Colombo, reasonably priced and of good quality.

There is a certain charm no doubt, although the hotel has definitely seen better days. But it is a well-known property and our taxi driver immediately knew where to take us. It is also very close to the Fort train stationãyou can walk there if you need to, and that's very convenient if you have a train to catch (which we did). The staff were extremely helpful, and my interaction with them was very smooth and satisfactory. The hotel has a beautiful bar/restaurant at the top with marvellous views of the harbour. I highly recommend getting a late-night drink here! However, overall, it's not good value for money. I'd have expected to pay less for my experience.",Date of stay: September 2017

Initially, I thought I made the wrong decision to book here because I did not find this place impressionable at all.  But after 2-3 nights, I then began to appreciate the rustic atmosphere of this property. From the bed to the floor to the tiles and pieces of furniture, I could say that they maintained the rustic atmosphere to stand with the rest of the luxury hotels in the city.  Yet I think they could still improve. They really need to improve the lighting in all floors and rooms. I also think they can improve the safety and security of the place.

The restaurant upstairs looked very second rate with tape over the ceilings, some plaster powder falling down ( they allowed us to move!) and the food was ok, but nothing special. Breakfast was good and plentiful.  Once again, the staff were excellent, sorted out a take out breakfast as we left early, and carried bags etc and helped sort out the problems we encountered.

I would rate it with backpackers lodgings but with a heftier price tag.  The meal in the evening was average but well priced for what we had.

The service was good, the room was comfortable, albeit dated, and the breakfast buffet was great. On my second stay, though, the rate was much higher, I was made to register for a second time - which is just inefficient after a long day of travelling - and I noticed just how dirty the tiled floor of the room was. I pointed this out to the staff, and hope they will improve the cleaning procedures, because it really was not good enough.

There was no hotel safe (an absolute must-have for travellers!), and the water pressure in the shower was hopeless. The left and right curtains were completely different lengths and the vent on the ceiling was rusty. The breakfast buffet was brilliant though. Other people have complained about wifi but it ran perfectly for us. In all honesty it wasn't a bad experience, but given the cost, it should have been much better.

Geoff G,Faded Grandeur,"The Grand Oriental Colombo is indeed a fading relic of a bygone age, but still radiates a certain charm. The deluxe rooms are spacious and the A/C works well, and the staff are nothing but polite and very helpful.  Bathrooms could do with a little loving care, and the minibar remains an unknown quantity - mine remained locked the entire time I was there, despite a couple of requests to please open it for me. Plenty of transport options around (if you like tuk-tuks), and close to train and bus stations and the Pettah / markets. A taxi from the airport cost about 3,000 rupiah (approx $30 AUS). The restaurant was a little disappointing - breakfast curries were dry and over-cooked, and the one morning I had the chicken sausages was the last.

Tienshan,"Large, rambling, slightly faded hotel well worth a visit.","We booked a night at the GOH at the end of our two weeks back packing in Sri Lanka to taste  a bit of style and history before leaving this sunny land. .They didn't reply to 2 or 3 emails requesting a quiet room so we weren't unduly surprised to be shown into one on the 3rd floor rather too close to a busy road. I asked Reception for a room change but was flatly refused- not a good start . However, to be fair the room was clean, cool and spacious with the very high ceiling favoured by Victorian Brits, and everything in it and in the bathroom worked fine. (except that my partner's I-pad couldn't pick up the wifi consistently.)  The immediate vicinity of the hotel isn't exactly salubrious- we walked past a guy feeding rice to some large rodents in the street about 250 mtrs.away-",Date of stay: November 2016
Edward W,"Historic architecture with by gone charm; amazing, classy buffet lunch","Not sure why so many people have given The Grand Oriental such bad ratings.  It's fantastically quaint, full of history and beautifully designed.  It's certainly not modern and if that's what you're looking for then this isn't the hotel for you, but the rooms are large, clean and extremely quiet.  Not to mention the buffet lunch for 1500 rupees was one of the best meals we've had in Sri Lanka, while the view of the shipping yard was really incredible. Additionally, the service was prompt and done with a smile.  What else could you ask for for the price? As a final point, I read a comment below that mentioned how this hotel reminded the reviewer of a Wes Anderson movie, with quirky charm around every corner.  I couldn't agree more.",Date of stay: November 2016

The room was a bit tired and not a true reflection of the website photos.  However, the buffet restaurant on the top floor is well worth a night time visit, even if you don't stay there - great views of the port.

Location indeed is fine, near the Dutch hospital area with some fine restaurants. We stayed here twice, the first time in a spacious room with a canopy bed. Second visit we had a small standard room, including a large skylight, making sure that the room is illuminated all night long, even when you would like to go to sleep. Bathrooms are very small and should be the first priority for an upgrade. Main asset is the restaurant on the top floor including a nice view of the harbor. Breakfast is ok. Main annoyance is the staff at reception. One would expect that when you return to a hotel a couple of weeks after your first visit",Date of stay: October 2016

NoniePony,Lots of character and charm,"To be fair, this is by no means a four star hotel, and is not a luxurious experience, but I am giving it extra credit for feeling like a delightful old world cruise ship crossed with a Wes Anderson movie. It is full of strange nooks and oddly (but charmingly) decorated rooms and feels like a slice of history. Plus, the breakfast room at the top overlooking the harbor is legit fabulous.

The hotel is centrally located, but in a run down block next to the port, which also describes the hotel. It is a beautiful Victorian era building which requires lots of work, like new lighting, new plumbing, new floorboard....etc. We made the mistake when booking on the web, not reading further down in smaller print, that a 30% tax went on top of the price that we thought we were paying. Definitely not worth 10,400 rupee! Also, be careful when ordering a taxi to take you to the airport, from the front desk. Make sure to get them to write down the agreed price.

Classical music played in the halls until late and rattling trolleys could be heard constantly up and down the halls all night.

Staff were lovely and very helpful. Bar has a good view of the harbours if you're into ships. Apparently Queen Elizabeth used to stay there.

Some of the reviews are variable but I enjoyed my stay very much. We stayed in off season so the place was virtually empty. In the evening we got tables in the restaurant right at the window with excellent views over the port. I have stayed at 3 star hotels in different parts of the world and in the UK. The service from  the staff left any UK hotel standing they were very attentive. Evening meals where acceptable up to Sri Lanka standards. perhaps not up to European standards. It seems fries with every meal that isn't curry is standard and few vegetables. Breakfast was fine if a little aimed towards Sri Lanka tastes. No pork,Date of stay: June 2016

Our room was huge with a wonderful polished wooden floor like a ballroom. The beds with their splendid wooden headboards were huge and very comfortable.

We were impressed with the service, choice of food in the restaurant and entertainment in the restaurant - a saxophonist on one of the nights we were there.

There is nothing modern about the amenities in the rooms except a tv and an air conditioning unit.  The rest of the building is not air conditioned so it is muggy in the halls and smells of smoke.

They also charged 650 rupees (about £3) for a bottle of beer which is more the kind of price I would expect to pay in London! I also found the staff a little rude and haughty at times.

The dinner buffet was great value and really tasty 1k SLR which was good, live entertainment singing the songs of times gone by adds to the experience.   Not really any negatives, the hotel is a bit tired (to be expected I guess) the location is not ideal either as its in the port and not really close to anything.

Everyone is confused about everything and everything needs ages to be solved.   As we are traveling across 8 countries we are staying in many hotels around the globe.

Only breakfast is okay, but their service overall is, hm, I would call it funny. Not very professional. At breakfast you have to ""hunt"" yourself for a cup, sugar ... ore you'll never see it. Once they gave my key to another guest and I couldn't enter my room. Not even a sorry from then. I would not stay again.",Date of stay: January 2015
Shehwaz,Old world charm,"It sure looks like the oldest hotel in all of colombo. Built in 1837, it still has a lot of the old world charm, combined with modernity here and there.  Rooms are pretty spacious but spartan, bed is super comfortable. It is frequented by a lot of locals too. The restaurants and pubs are very good, all the staff is very helpful and ready for any kind of assistance. the look outside the windows is not that great but you can see the sea at a distance. Tariffs are alright compared to the facilities offered. Good place to stay all in all",Date of stay: January 2015
puchka,Historical Building !,"Right next to the docks and adjacent to the Police ststion, the hotel is ideally located for tourist.  The grandeur of the building is more evident in the reception area with antique pieces spread all around that draw a lot of attention.  The rooms have period furniture and the entire woodwork kept in its original form.   The bed is comfortable and linen clean.  Toilets however are way to small to even move around for a bigger built person.  No tea/coffee service provided in the rooms but on asking we were given an electric kettle and two cups which was very much appreciated.

Laura S,Update required,"The hotel has a quite good location, at a walking distance to the beach and to the raÍl way station and the bus stop to the airport, and there are also some shops close by. However, it is clear they need a little bit of investment. The service was not the best and the room was not very clean.  The room was very big but the view to the backyard showed that some painting in the beautiful colonial faades is required.  They offered us some juice when we arrived, and that was very nice, but then there were like eight guys in the reception and it took them a while to give us the key to our room.  We paid 68$ and I think that, in Sri Lanka, for the quality of the services, the price was very high.",Date of stay: January 2015

Bobbicz,History,"If you're interested in reliving a piece of history you'll like GOH as the view of the port from the restaurant hasn't changed since the building was constructed in 1837.  The rooms and furnishings haven't changed since probably 1930 but are fortunately air conditioned.  The staff is extremely pleasant and the reception staff speak excellent English  Be sure to book your transfer from the airport to the hotel when you book. It will cost you —50 but taxi fare is even more.  I don't recommend the hotel spa. It's terribly ordinary and not conducive to relaxation. The hotel is an easy walk both to the fun outside markets and the financial district.  Or you can take a ""tuc tuc"". A 3 wheeled buggy that zooms in and out of traffic like a June bug.

JustOnTheWay,Good value for money - urgently needs refurbishment,"My first thought entering the hotel was: ""Where did I end up here?"". Both, building and service were quite dusty. After quite a walk I came to my room with its scratched furniture which seemed to have been repaired by amateurs. Only the short film about the hotel which you can watch on TV channel 1 reminded of the better days of this hotel... I heard that the hotel might be refurbished soon. I guess that's a great plan!  The reason why I still rate the hotel with 3 stars is the good restaurant in 4th floor with an incredible view over the harbour. Considering the age of the hotel you can imagine the landing sailing ships. Btw. breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets are recommendable. All in all prices in the hotel are reasonable.  A big plus is also the area of the nearby former",Date of stay: December 2014

And yet the ""Kangaroo"" taxi driver (picking me up from the CMB airport) has had to ask ~10 pedestrians/policemen/drivers before we could find this hotel.  The room was big and the single bed with the canopy was also big.  There was AC which worked though a bit on the noisy side.  There was TV with a few useful English channels such as BBC and Al Jazeera.  ( In the 2 days that I was there, the most that these English channels talked about seemed to be the death of Australian cricket player Philip Hughes. )  It's nice that they provided you 2 bottles of water every day (free of charge).

Rudi M,Very Dated but Charming,"Not so easy to write a balanced review. I enjoyed my stay at the GOH, as I was very interested to learn more about the history of this grand old dame. There is certainly plenty of history here and most of it is on display. With the old business district in the Fort area finally seeing a revival, it is indeed interesting to walk around the neighborhood here and take in one more time how the Asian city of the past looked like and functioned. There are not too many left, as development and commercial interests take first priority and the old and established is often either demolished and replaced or over-renovated. The GOH sets you back in time for a short period and makes one wonder how the passengers on one of the steamers arriving here would be longing for the GOH's hospitality",Date of stay: November 2014

Sarah R,Oasis in the desert,I did not stay at the GOH. I did have breakfast and lunch here. It has a huge breakfast and lunch buffet at an extremely reasonable price. It also has table service. The waiters wear sailor outfits.  They have free wifi. Beautiful view of the Harbour. Outdoor patio. I'm speaking specifically of the 4th floor dining room. It has a piano player who is very good as well. This is a wonderful place to decompress.  The food is good and the view of the harbor is awesome. It's a bastion of civility and calmness in crazy colombo. You must go if you are looking for good safe food at a reasonable price in a lovely atmosphere. My guide took me here and we had breakfast together.  I was very impressed by the place. A wonderful place to relax.  One of my fav places in sri lanka.,Date of stay: October 2014

Being my first time to Sri Lanka, I was eager to stay in a property reminiscent of a bygone era. My wife and I live in very modern home, so a chance to stay in something a little dated but with some old world charm initially appealed to us.   I'd found out that the Grand Oriental had once been a Dutch barracks dating back hundreds of years. Apparently Queen Elizabeth herself had even stayed there once.  But the truth is that this place is not as charming and lovely as they would have you believe. The sheen has certainly dissipated from this onetime, ""gem of the orient.""

Although there are numerous extravagant/expensive establishments in Colombo, the GOH indeed has the best locality of them all. The view of the Colombo Harbour from the Harbour room is simply breathtaking. I remember the last time I was there at the Harbour room with my family sometime back, we were taken on a musical trip down memory lane by Sam the Man. This hall also brings many sentimental memories to my family as both my parents & grandparents had both had their wedding receptions many years ago. Sam the Man had provided music for my parents' wedding.  It is unfair to compare the GOH to other more modern recently built, overpriced hotels in Colombo.

The rooms are spacious and have heritage furniture..  the table was rocking but then who cares when you are surrounded by heritage all around.  The corridors have wonderful pictures.

Mendes Osiris C,"No, no, no","I have stayed there during my 3 weeks trip in Sri Lanka. During my first visit I stayed at Taj Samundra, which was absolutely lovely. On my return I wanted to try another hotel and was recommended to stay at GOH because of the good views on the harbor. While views on the harbor are good and the rooms are spacious, everything else, literally, is rather poor.  From the moment you enter the lobby it smells old. I hate that smell. Once I entered the room it was dull and cold. The interior must be from when the hotel was built 200 years ago. The bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom was dirty. The worst however about having a harbor view is the fact that you can hear the loud noises of the harbor all night long. Believe it or not, but those rooms are the most expensive in the hotel.",Date of stay: October 2013

For me she is value for money, history, location close to Main Street, the Harbour View restaurant is special, and even the local bar/nightclub downstairs can be 'interesting' to say the least. Staff on both my visits have been courteous and efficient. GOH is located in an exciting part of town - the old dutch hospital precinct is starting to 'happen' and Sri Lankans are understanding that not all tourists want to visit gleaming shopping malls.

The rooms were dirty and seedy while the corridors were tunnels where guests were allowed to smoke as there were no balconies in any of the rooms. The bed was very normal and we had to request for extra pillows as only two were left for triple occupancy. The bathrooms were the worst. The plumbing was terribly leaky with cockroaches. There was no hot water and when we complained about the leaking toilet drain and the lack of hot water, the staff took over an hour to respond. They then came over and said we won't get hot water as the water heater was solar powered.

We settled for another which had a GOH signature king size lace-draped four poster bed, a three piece lounge suite, dressing table, full length mirror and overlooked the historic Port Authority Building and harbor.

Positive points about the hotel:  1.	The location of the hotel is suitable for business purposes as the hotel is just at a walking distance from the Petta Market and shopping.

The restaurant staff were also in a daze and cared a hoot to the customers.  Dont recommend a business traveller to stay there unless extreme emergency.,Date of stay: September 2012

We proceeded to the restaurant on the 4th floor for drinks which was fine, however on walking out of the restaurant on to the corridor a large rat ran out along the side of the corridor and into what looked like the kitchen (the duty manager pointed out after that it was a service corridor).

Vivien E,Worst Hotel I have stayed in!,"The only thing Grand about this hotel was the name!.  The air conditioning in my room did not work, the shower recess flooded the bathroom and when I put my laundry out it did not all come back.  The hotel staff did not try to locate the laundry items and sent three men to my room to obtain a description of the lost underwear.  The hotel was not clean and there were small piles of dirt in various locations.  The food was very ordinary.  The hotel was large and the lifts way too small.  In an emergency such as a fire it would be bedlam.  Fortunately I was able to find alternate  accommodation for the remainder of my stay in Columbo.

Fahri B,only for nostalgia lovers,"GOH is probably the oldest hotel in Colombo. If you love nostalgia, it`s the right place to stay. Even Chehov stayed in that place. But..GOH needs definitely refurbishment!!! Especially bad rooms. I stayed 3times in GOH and always were the same case with bad rooms : quite old and not 100% clean.  Since the hotel was used to be a barrack for the British army most of the rooms are quite big. Generally it is quite loud in the hotel. Staff is not so professional. The single room price( 96 USD incl. breakfast) is a little bit to high for this hotel. But I guesssince all the other hotels in Colombo are much more expensive, the GOH Management dont see any need to change it.

The staff at the reception were so rude and unfriendly. Though we were booked into the new wing, the staff refused to provide us rooms there. Instead we were shown rooms at the old wing which had heavy cigarette and liquor stench, old furniture, a noisy air-conditioner and the list can go on. No progress even after our tour agent had spoken with the Manager. When we turned down the old wing rooms, the Manager told us curtly that we could leave. Fortunately, our tour agent made alternative arrangements at The Hilton where we had a wonderful stay. I strongly advise anyone",Date of stay: June 2012

Sleep was almost impossible due to the noise from outside and then oncve that had stopped, someone in the restaurant above our room decided it would be a good idea to start hammering and drilling at 2am.

We stayed at a range of accommodations in Sri Lanka from 5 star luxury to backpacker style.  This place was by far the most expensive and worst.  After several emails back and forward I eventually managed to secure a room at quite a high price, as it was only for one night and the right side of the city for the airport I accepted the price.  However, the price quoted was far different to what you actually pay once they have added on a myriad of taxes and service charges.

We travelled here on the last night of our holiday in Sri Lanka as a place to see Colombo and in my case see the last day of the cricket between England and Sri Lanka. The check in was a bit of a farce. We had booked the room through an independent booking site and somehow the booking had got mixed up. Even though we had evidence by email, it did seem like the staff didn't believe us and were determined to prove us wrong. After waiting about an hour, eventually the manager came in to say he had found his booking and offered us a room in the hotel.

All looked a bit dated. Noise from the corridors as well as from outside reach your room. When telling the reception about loud music and screaming in the corridors they just answered ""yes but it is a group!"" so if you are group you are entitled to ruin the other guests sleep???

The front office staff were not among the best for sure. The rooms were very average. Room service was ordinary. The bathrooms were decent. And dont expect to watch your favourite shows in this hotel since the TV was barely viewable not to mention the fact there were barely any channels to view from.

They say it is a 3 star hotel but it is worst than a ordinary road side motel or lodge.  I would never recommend this hotel for anyone.",Date of stay: April 2010
MrChrisP,thinking about this place - STOP RIGHT NOW!!!!,"The reception staff were very unfriendly and they recycle the food, we had food poisoning very badly, my colleague is from India and regularly eats street food, even his system could not stand up this VERY DANGEROUS TRIAL!!",Date of stay: April 2010
Pahari,A relic of days gone by.....,"Grand old structure, right next to the docks. Needs a bit of livening up though.  Once barracks, it's rooms though cozy still retain acertain dinginess.  Great breakfast spread.",Date of stay: February 2010
hotelfinderLondon,Noises in the night,Old hotel built in the 1920;s with 4 poster beds but has not be maintained well. I was on the 3rd floor  and during the night I heard what I think was rat in the roof space. When complained to the hotel desk I was asked if the rat had come to see me when I said it had not they said that is good then  The breakfast is very standard but kettles are not provided would not go back there.,Date of stay: February 2010
KENT F,"Excellent hotel for under $60, fabulous staff","Arrived early 9am and was checked in Early. Great room, high ceilings, old school but comfortable. Room and sheets were clean. Has a fabulous dinner buffet for US$10 with an awesome view. Trust me there is little choice in Colombo, so this was the best for the price. Its close to the beach and a great central spot. You can use the galle park hotel pool for US$10 so I just did that. Staff were lovely. Just tip a little and it will make your stay a little more enjoyable (50 cents, etc)",Date of stay: February 2010
A Tripadvisor Member,Grand Oriental Review,The hotel is located next to the harbour with a nice view from the 4th floor restaurant. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. There is a huge variety of food for the buffet breakfast. The rooms have air con and have a TV. There are a few bars in the hotel and the restaurant has a nice location. The rooms are clean and in general the hotel is good value for money.,Date of stay: January 2010

YuudaiKot,Ok but not as expected,"I was impressed by the name of the hotel, ""Grand"", ""Oriental"" but it was not as expected. The room was not clean enough, the staff seemed to be not really willing and helful. However, the food was quite good, the location is excellent, with a beautiful harbour view. not advise for those who will have a long stay.",Date of stay: April 2009
Trinz,Very Stuffy,"the hotel is located in a very high security area, but offers a wonderful view of the harbour, the rooms were very stuffy, musty and smelt of cigarett smoke, the staff was extremely rude, and did not bother to come and replace the TV remote inspite of calling them more than 5 times. the food also had very few options and was totally forgettable. overall not a very pleasant experience",Date of stay: December 2008

lavatea,Misled by the name and history,"The entrance and reception are good, The rooms are untidy, the food is good, especially the buffet served at night.   The bar has a good view of the port. There is no pool, The club attached to the Grand Oriental is also not so Grand, just a cheap pick-up joint.   THe larger problem is there is  nothing in the vicinity of the hotel after evening hours. Being the old port area and now a commercial hub, this area is deserted after evening.  The hotel displays a old brass memorial depicting when and how this hotek was built. I must however admit that this feeling of staying in a historic hotel kept me going for 2 days. Not even worth the $ 100 odd that they charge per room.",Date of stay: September 2006
A Tripadvisor Member,Good location but old room facility!,"Location is close to the train station and beach. A good variety of buffet breakfast both for western and SriLanka styles. This historical hotel has nostalgic atmosphere. You can put your valuable belongs in the safety box in lobby for free. The double room we stayed was spacious, but the decoration/facility was old. The room was a bit dark in the evening. I heard that some rooms were renovated, but not the one we stayed. If you want to experience the historical hotel, this could be a good choice. I will try other hotels next time.",Date of stay: November 2009
A Tripadvisor Member,Beautiful outside/Inside needs work,"Sadly, I did enjoy Colombo at all. It is under heavy security so I would recommend going south to one of the small beach towns to truly appreciate the incredible beauty that Sri Lanka has to offer from the people to the amazing water and food. However The Grand Oriental needs serious work. Also the club below that is associated with the hotel is seedy and really should either be shut down or changed into something more appropriate. It is traditional Indian dancers, but they look miserable and you can tell that the scene is more than just a place to drink. I would recommend staying at the Cinnamon Grand, The Hilton, or a different Hotel.   The most irritating thing is that the hotel constantly tried to cheat us out of money by arranging tours without our permission. I would go",Date of stay: September 2009
A Tripadvisor Member,"Grand Oriental Hotel, Colombo","The Grand Oriental definitely recalls the days of the Raj, with its beautifully appointed marble floored reception area and grand staircase. The staff are deferential and discreet but still friendly. The coffee shop is excellent value - the club sandwich with chips at around 1.50GBP being excellent value for money. Airport transfers at around 15GBP (per taxi) from the in-house travel agent also reasonably priced and reliable for our 5am pick up.",Date of stay: August 2009

sendilse,The colonial building,"The first thing that struck me about this hotel is its colonial architecture. Its a part of history. The hotel is overseeing the port and provides good view of the sea. The tariff is very cheap for the facilities. There is no swimming pool though. If you don't believe spending too much on hotels but want a nice place to stay with no frills, then Grand oriental is the place. As soon as you enter the hotel for check-in, you are greeted warmly and while you are filling up the form, you are served with a refreshing welcome drink. I was very impressed and thank ful for the same since it was very hot outside and after a long drive from the airport, it feels good to gulp something cold !... The hotel is located in a nice place and there is a tap bar which can be a nice place to hang",Date of stay: March 2006
Sharat K,avoidable,"It's not good at all...the rooms and the hotel stink badly.  Especially the old wing.  If they are giving you the old wing, please don't fall for the charm of it, it is sick and horrible.  the only good part is the spa and the food...",Date of stay: August 2008
Nathan227,Decent value for money with sufficient hotel restaurant,Room was spacious with quiet air con and cold fridge. Bathroom had bathtub with hot water which is a rare find in SL. Staff were friendly. Location is good for those wanting to do some sight seeing around Colombo and great for those catching the train to other parts of the country (central train station only a few blocks away). Business centre pricing is excessively expensive and the attach nightclub is a depressing venue to walk into.,Date of stay: February 2009
A Tripadvisor Member,Good value for money,Grand Oriental is good value for money. Rooms are spacious and clean. Sanitary has been recently replaced and is working!Staff is  very friendly. The hotel is located in the high safety area with high number of security checkpoints.The area is therefore very desolated which makes you feel like staying in ghost town.,Date of stay: January 2009
aroonanand,Nothing Grand or Oriental about it,"I was also one of the travellers to be fooled by the description of the hotel in the website and snaps..The reception and lobby was the only decent part of the hotel. Old room with furniture probably 50 years old, noisy AC...Staff were ok but incapable lot at the reception. Tried to overcharge me for the 10% charge I paid online as well as by breaking the cost into several items to confuse me, and internet which did not work. Food ordered in room service was quite nice. No facility to make phone calls from room, which was just simply ridiculous...Had to use this hotel at the last minute as Ceylon Continental bungled with my booking and did not get a room which was pre-booked and paid 10 days in advance !!!   Advice to travellers - stay away from the Grand Oriental. Might have",Date of stay: October 2008
VincentOne,Never stay at this place !,"Don't be fooled by this hotel's name - undoubtedly it was a ""Grand Oriental Hotel"" - but that was 100 years ago. The lobby is probably the nicest part of the hotel, it's all steep downhill from there. The hotel overall is really dilapidated. We stayed one night, actually checked out at 3am to catch an onward flight and were glad to leave the hotel. It was truely one of the worst if not THE worst hotel I've ever stayed in the past 20 years.  The hotel corridors were dark and gloomy, we didn't see any other tourists/travelers in lobby, restaurant or elsewhere.  After phoning the hotel's general manager, we were upgraded to a bigger room, because our first room had a noisy rattling A/C. The room had dark brown coarse terracotta tiles, probably from the sixties. The room's walls,",Date of stay: September 2008
shakyscorpion,Never stay if its free as well,"The room ambiance was good, without a bath, and hot water and a/c were unreliable Things went well until the last day when we had to leave for the airport early morning. We had settled the bill previous day and when we were about to leave they came back saying we didnêt pay the Mini Bar Bill. There was a heated argument and the Hotel manager behaved indecently and he was about to hit us and we had to open our luggage and show him the bill after which he said –Sorry” typical sri-lankan. We had to rush up to Airport with Little children and had really hurry up due to this.  This made us almost miss our flight. We placed several complaints through many channels. The bedroom, even it was large, had a bedspread that was stained and filthy looking, and both the curtains around the bed",Date of stay: August 2008
DeadSeaFisherman,"good food, bad room","it is a good value hotel, rooms r not so good, some rooms r terrible!!, food could be the best in Colombo and nice view of harbour at harbour view restaurant, service is ok, I do not recommend it for business people.",Date of stay: May 2003
furhan,so much potential going to waste,"* Beautiful building * Fine interiors * Weird hot water system * Friendly, polite, courteous staff, like most people in Colombo * Harbour restaurant has a very fine view and the breakfast is just great  Things went well until the last day when we had to leave for the airport in afternoon. Came back after some last minute shopping only to discover that the lock in our room had been removed and there were 5 people inside doing God knows what - They said, it was the room service. We had explicitly told the staff at the desk that we would ASK for a room service when we need one. The beds were made but did we ask them for that? and what kind of room service removes the door knobs to enter. To make matters worse, they asked us to pay for a bottle of water that we used from their",Date of stay: March 2007
TravelBugHet,Breakfast like a King!,"We arrived in Sri Lanka after a month backpacking round Japan on a budget. After a month in youth hostels, any hotel was going to be good, but the Grand Oriental was something else!! Porters opened the doors for us and ushered us into the grand lobby, the staff were lovely, everything was beautiful. Our room was big and airy, high cielings, comfortable beds. The hotel is wonderfully located in the heart of Colombo, in a great area to just wander around, very close to markets. The breakfast was absolutely fabulous - a buffet affair with so much to choose from! There was English type cooked breakfast (sausages, bacon etc) as well as Sri Lankan curries, chapatis etc. Cold buffet of meats and cheeses, fruit platters, various breads and pastries, and of course plenty of Ceylon tea.",Date of stay: September 2006
FULL-SPEED-AHEAD,A fading lady,"What was once a Grand hotel is now a faded lady. Excellent service and food and the hotel has a top floor restaurant giving a wonderful overview of the harbour and ships coming and going. The ground floor Sri Lankan restaurant served a near  lukewarm buffet on the night we ate there. The bedroom, whilst large, had a bedspread that was stained and grubby looking, and both the curtains around the bed and at the windows looked as though they hadn't been cleaned in years. Rather bizarrely, the bottom bed sheet didn't cover all the mattress so you had to rest on the bare mattress. The ensuite bathroom looked as though it was last updated in the 60's. With the advent of air travel and demise of passenger ships, the hotel is now out on a limb and right next to the high security zone.",Date of stay: November 2006
MikeWReading,Cheaper than others but you get what you pay for!,"Stayed here for 10 days in March/April 2006.  Booking through a travel agent got the rate down to $45 per night, but the room was very small, without a bath, and hot water and a/c were erratic.  The views from the harbour restaurant are good (and the sailors uniforms for the staff are amusing) but you're not supposed to take photos as the port is a high security area.  Roads are cordoned off at night (10 p.m to 5 a.m, when the barriers are removed which can be very noisy!), so it's a bit like being in a war zone.  The staff are generally quite friendly, and it could be a really great hotel, but sadly it isn't.",Date of stay: April 2006
Daisy005,Lovely locally-owned hotel,"We stayed with a party of friends at the Grand Oriental which is locally-owned, situated overlooking the harbour, near to the city centre.  Great views from the restaurant over the city and the busy docks. Food was international and uninspiring. All the waiting staff wore what seemed to be Navy uniforms.  Views were not so great from many of the rooms, but ours had a four-poster bed with drapes like gypsy caravan.  Finding a bar to have a few relaxing drinks proved elusive.  There were only high bar stools and no comfortable chairs.",Date of stay: February 2006
