Derek,3 Nights at the Kingsbury,"The bed was the hugest that I have ever slept in! I enjoyed the breakfasts; the dining area was vast and offered a great variety of food.

Tantilizing the taste buds with the variety and amazing service. Always the first choice by our family.

Chef Jayasinghe and the breakfast staff carved out a sumptuous breakfast for us. The special attention they gave us will be remembered for a very long time. Hoppers (both egg hoppers and panni hoppers) are hard to replicate anywhere. The fruit platter (like mangoes) and the thambili was like the icing on the cake. Breakfast could not get any better.

Jimmy,Great service - Jimmy karanjia,This is the first time I stayed at the Kingsbury hotel. Used to be regular at cinnamon grand. Kingsburys got a great vibe and the view from the rooms overlooking the Indian Ocean is great.i was at the executive room on the 9th level. The room id say is average but what impressed me most was the customer service all around. The staff is extremely courteous and I would like to make a special mention of Diego and Shiwangi who took great care of me in the executive lounge on the 9th floor.

Dave LG,"The ""posh"" part of town","Was here for a wedding and to see Colombo. This hotel is right in the middle of where you want to be to see the sights in Colombo- The Presidential buildings are next door, markets, St Anthony's cathedral, temples, CCC (Shopping centre) and Galle face (park) are all within walking distance or 5-10 mins by tuk tuk.

Like most SL hotels, peak period room rates are higher than comparable rates in other SE Asian destinations. Restaurant prices a bit on the high side. Minor comment - Noticed a few small cockroaches around the place, even in the spa room! Can be a common problem in tropical climates and not restricted to this hotel.

Sudheendra K,My Kingsbury Hotel experience in Colombo,"This is a great hotel -- not only because of its location (facing the ocean), not only because of its quiet elegance (both external and internal), but most importantly because of its highly dedicated and efficient staff who make extra efforts to ensure your stay in Colombo becomes memorable.I stayed in this hotel for eight days on my recent (first) visit to Sri Lanka. Everything about this hotel is so welcoming, symbolising the best of Sri Lankan hospitality -- subtle and sure, but not overbearing. The hotel is quiet, and yet very convenient. The rooms are very clean. If there is one thing lacking, it's this -- it serves only one kind of 'dosa' for breakfast.

The table was not cleared after a course was done,while we went to grab the next one, resulting in quite a crowded table and I had to constantly ask the staff to fill my glass with water.

R0bertBROWN,Overwhelming hospitality.,"We'd been in Sri Lanka for a couple of weeks and sadly, our last day arrived. Our flight was at night, it was hot, a thunder storm was expected and we needed to check out of our hotel. This was on new year's day and everything was closed, I really mean pretty much everything. The afternoon was not looking like a fun one, but thankfully our hotel called The Kingsbury and a plan was made.  The Kingsbury served lunch to non-guests and made a reasonable charge for use of the pool. Suddenly, things were looking up.  The lunch was a buffet and by this time, I was a bit bored with this sort of thing, but the quality and variety of the food was excellent, far better than anything I'd had so far.

If anything the rooms were a bit bland and of what you would expect for a business hotel.","{'name': ['airport', 'Kingbury', 'Columbo', 'buffet style restaurant', 'style', 'hotel', 'tea', 'food', 'presenter', 'guests', 'quality', 'selections', 'Some', 'reviews', 'building', 'anything', 'business hotel', 'rooms', 'story', 'development'], 'type': ['LOCATION', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'LOCATION', 'OTHER', 'LOCATION', 'CONSUMER_GOOD', 'OTHER', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'OTHER', 'OTHER', 'PERSON', 'WORK_OF_ART', 'LOCATION', 'OTHER', 'LOCATION', 'LOCATION', 'OTHER', 'OTHER']}",0.2,3.0

It's one of the biggest spread I have ever seen. It had all Sri Lankan traditional foods and all western foods and a variety of sweets. The pool area is nice and big and the kids spent long hours in the pool. The pizza bar near the pool is quite good as well . It's located quite close to all other major hotels and Restaurants in Galle face area.  Staff are quite helpful and friendly .

MartanneFromOz,Great hotel and location.,We stayed a the Kingsbury twice during our 2 weeks in Sri Lanka and we were impressed with the hotel and the rooms. The hotel is very popular with locals for functions and wonderful weddings.  The Kingsbury is ideally located however major waterfront works have ruined the views but hopefully this is only a short term issue.  As the air-conditioning made the restaurants too cold to be in for any longer than a quick meal or drink we would highly recommend the Sky Lounge to while away a few hours at night. The pool area was pleasant but noisy with the construction works nearby.

Alex H,Great location for exploring the old Colombo on foot.,"The Kingsbury is a top class hotel with excellent facilities. The location was great and after being dropped off at the market (by tuk tuk from front of hotel) we were able to wander back through the diplomatic quarter which has beautiful old colonial buildings including the presidential palace.  Many of these old buildings are being restored so it should be even better in a few years time.  The Dutch Hospital complex is just across the road where there are shops and great restaurants which we preferred to the buffet offered at the hotel although this was also excellent.

So not really sure what I was getting for this upgrade.  The room was very clean but slightly weathered.  The desk was chipped and some scuffs on the wall, and the carpet could of been given a clean, however there were no huge stains on it or anything.  But the bed and bedding was comfortable and I have to admit that the room cleaning service on cleaning and fold down service was very good. Room service itself was good but had run out of pizza dough one evening when I ordered.

Karl-Heinz H,Great Classic Hotel almost the British way,"After having been for thre weeks all over ceylon on the west coast south and almost all the sightseeing mentioned in lonely planet, we were looking forward to a upscale hotel in the buzzle of the major city of Ceylon. The rooms are functioning but we wanted to have a sea view room and ended up looking on  a not well maintained parking lot The restaurant, cafe, and the reception area is busy with employees. Would be great if there were fewer of them but more efficient in their output. We had always the impression that half of them is in training The flower bouquets in the lobby were nice as well as the choice of goodies, they serve as breakfast.

The staff is highly trained, experienced and professional. They keep guests as the focus of their actions and provide unbeatable experience.

Anita F,Nice way to end our holiday,My boyfriend and I stayed here on the last night of our holiday in Sri Lanka. We thought we would treat ourselves and we were not disappointed.  We had a lovely open corner room overlooking the Indian Ocean. It was so lovely to wake up to this view in the morning.   The room itself was very spacious and clean. The bathroom was a decent size too. From what I can remember the bed was very comfortable.  As it was our last day in Sri Lanka we wanted to get the last bit of sun before heading back to London so spent most of the day by the pool.

As learned from staff, six marriage event done in one day. Overall good hotel. Service is OK, staff is friendly. Rooms are small. There are three restaurants and they advised to eat steak in bar. It was wrong choice. Hotel restaurants are closing due to other organizations. For example one of lady staff told me buffet will close during Sunday breakfast.

That was rectified without asking so great service.   We lounged around the pool. Service was attentive. We had a couple of massages, again service was good. Needed those knots kneaded out of our necks and backs.   We had dinner at Ocean. Seafood was great and we indulged. The breakfast buffet was opulent and wide ranging. And then we checked out, a misunderstanding was quickly sorted out.

LM009,What poor management is about...,"I had to stay 5 days at the Kingsbury and honestly I took some times before to book because the hotel infrastructures in Colombo are not great due to lack of investment during the last 20 years. So hotels are usually old. Hopefully they are now building 10 new hotels and soon the Shangri La and the Hyatt will open. I thought the Kingsbury was one of them as newly renovated. To summarise:  Good things: rooms are well renovated. Bed is comfortable .Bathrooms well designed. Big window. Nice location in front of the sea. The pool area. The food.  Bad things: do not look at the details as the renovation has been made quickly. The lobby is busy, noisy with good buffets all around making the impression we are in court food rather than an hotel. Do not book a room at the executive floor",Date of stay: July 2014,"I had to stay 5 days at the Kingsbury and honestly I took some times before to book because the hotel infrastructures in Colombo are not great due to lack of investment during the last 20 years. So hotels are usually old. Hopefully they are now building 10 new hotels and soon the Shangri La and the Hyatt will open. I thought the Kingsbury was one of them as newly renovated.

JONATHAN R,Get back to basic  Customer  Service,Visited  this hotel many times under different  names never had issues.  Until our last visit.  We were  visiting  Sri Lanka after 10 years and we were recommended  by friends  to stay at Kingsbury  when  we were in Colombo.  The Hotel appearance  definitely  has improved  and loved the interior work.  Right from check in we dealt  with  un trained staff  who struggled  to deal with basic customer service  skills.   They  had our reservation  all messed  up and after 45 minutes  accepted  they made a mistake. Never  apologized or empathized for the delay.  The elevator was another  mess could take upto 15 minutes  to  get one as there was only 2 elevators for such  a large  Hotel.  On the 7th floor  we smelled Smoke  in our rooms clearly  someone  was smoking  in the rooms.  The,Date of stay: June 2014,Visited  this hotel many times under different  names never had issues.

JXM1956,Comfortable with a Colonial Feel,We stayed here for 2 nights on our trip to Sri Lanka.  Rooms were small but comfortable and clean.  Pool area is nice and there's a caf√© that provides snacks at reasonable prices. We ate here one night (buffet) and it was ok.  Breakfast good in the morning with plenty of choice.

poshw5,A lovely stay!,The Kingsbury is a delightful experience. It has an old colonial feel but is also very modern and has been renovated to a very high standard. The pool was lovely and the room was great.  We ordered room service for breakfast and lunch and both times it turned up cold which was a shame but it was still tasty. My suggestion would be to supply slightly harder pillows as they only had feather and very soft pillows so an alternative would just make the hotel that much more accommodating!  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Kingsbury as a great choice for your Colombo stay.,Date of stay: April 2014,The Kingsbury is a delightful experience.

mrmoorthe,Service could be better,"Stayed here for 1 night only. The rooms are nice and new. After sitting in the room not 5 mins after arrival reception staff called to ask if everything was ok and then for some unexplained reason asked what time we were checking out the next day. I thought this was pretty uncalled for since we had just checked in. Its a small thing but it leaves a little undesirable taste. Was not impressed about this  Asked the concierge for some recommendation on some local seafood, and all he could mention was the ministry of crab which everyone knows is the most expensive seafood place in the whole of the country. Pushed for a better recommendation with explicitly instruction to advice on a local place he suggested a terrible restuarant which I have been to few years back and then says",Date of stay: April 2014,"Stayed here for 1 night only.

Gronings_Expat,Superb end of dream holiday,"We stayed the last two nights before returning home at The Kingsbury. The location is perfect to discover old Colombo on foot which we did. Our room was on the 8th floor and through the huge window we had a stunning view towards Galle Face green and Galle Road. Spacious with a lovely bed, super cushions a a beautiful bathroom we had nothing more to wish for. The rooftop terrace was the ideal place to enjoy a drink or two, and the menu offers fabulous food. After a day of sightseeing in Colombo the pool is the place to refresh and relax on the sunbeds. All the staff were very friendly and very keen in making our stay as comfortable as possible. So we can highly recommend this hotel and hope to come back again.",Date of stay: April 2014,"We stayed the last two nights before returning home at The Kingsbury.

Daniel T,Vast improvement in 12 months,"We gave this hotel a second visit after a mediocre visit last year simply because it was one of the cheaper 'good' hotels and we were only passing through for one night.  I am happy to report that the teething problems seem to have been ironed out and that our stay was very pleasant this time around. Rooms are small but very nicely kitted out and offer good views. The pool area now has a bar etc which is always a plus! and the buffet offered in the restaurant if excellent, offering a vast array of tasty food including some local dishes. Check in/out was a lot smoother this time and we were able to securely store our luggage after check out until our airport transfer.
